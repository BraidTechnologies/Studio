**BoxerDataTest_v2.py**

This code facilitates persona-based question generation and similarity calculations using the OpenAI API. 

The `configure_openai_for_azure` function sets up the Azure OpenAI client using an API configuration. The `TestResult` class stores details about test questions, including enrichment summaries and relevance.

The `call_openai_chat` function executes OpenAI API calls with retry logic to manage network issues. The `get_text_embedding` function retrieves text embeddings, ensuring data is in the correct format for subsequent similarity calculations.

Cosine similarity between embedding vectors is calculated with `cosine_similarity`. The `generate_enriched_question` function enriches questions using the OpenAI API.

`process_questions` handles question evaluation, checking relevance based on existing data chunks. The `read_processed_chunks` function loads JSON files from a directory, while `save_results` stores processed test results.

`run_tests` orchestrates test execution, including generating questions with the specified persona strategy and ensuring all components work together harmoniously.

**PersonaStrategy.py**

This code provides a framework for generating persona-based questions using an AI chat model.

The key import statements include modules for abstract classes, logging, and OpenAI API interactions. The current and parent directories are added to the Python path to access common configurations and functions.

An abstract class `PersonaStrategy` defines the method `generate_questions`, which must be implemented by subclasses for different personas. The `_generate_questions` method interacts with the OpenAI API to generate questions based on a given prompt.

Concrete classes `DeveloperPersonaStrategy`, `TesterPersonaStrategy`, and `BusinessAnalystPersonaStrategy` extend `PersonaStrategy` to implement question generation for specific personas such as developers, testers, and business analysts.

**run_BoxerDataTest.py**

**Classes/Functions:**
- `run_tests`
- `ApiConfiguration`

**Summary:**
The script begins by importing necessary modules and adjusting the Python path to include the project root and script directories. It sets up a logger for informational messages. The `questions` list contains various questions related to Large Language Models (LLMs).

The script creates an `ApiConfiguration` instance, defines the directories for test outputs and data sources, and ensures the test output directory exists, logging any issues encountered. Finally, it calls `run_tests` with the configuration, directories, and question list, and uses error handling to log any exceptions that occur during the testing process.

**TestRunner.py**

This script sets up and runs tests on a BoxerDataTest_v5 module, allowing the user to select different test modes. It starts by setting up the logging configuration and modifying the system path to include the parent directory of the script for module imports.

The `TestRunner` function initializes the API configuration, sets up clients for chat completions and embeddings through Azure OpenAI, and defines test output and data directories. The function then creates the test output directory if it does not exist. Based on user input, it runs static question tests or persona-based tests (Developer, Tester, or Business Analyst).

Important functions and classes:
- `TestRunner()`
- `run_tests`
- `ApiConfiguration`
- `configure_openai_for_azure`
- `DeveloperPersonaStrategy`
- `TesterPersonaStrategy`
- `BusinessAnalystPersonaStrategy`.
