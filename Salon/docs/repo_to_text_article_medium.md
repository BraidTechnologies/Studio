# introduction

Working with large codebases is like navigating an unfamiliar city without a map: each module and function is a new street, every dependency an intersection, and understanding the bigger picture can feel like solving a puzzle in the dark. For developers, this often leads to hours of poring over code, deciphering poorly documented functions, and trying to untangle dependencies, all while keeping the broader goals in mind.

To address these challenges, I turned to Google’s NotebookLM—a tool taht could be used for interactive exploration and document-based insights. With its powerful language model, NotebookLM lets me “converse” with a codebase, turning complex repositories into something closer to a dialogue. By uploading the code as text files, I can ask NotebookLM for summaries, explanations, and even new code suggestions. In short, it’s like having a knowledgeable (and very patient) coding partner, making large codebases easier to understand, manage, and expand.

This article will show you how I use NotebookLM to turn sprawling repositories into clear, accessible resources. With NotebookLM, I can quickly understand core functionalities, uncover how different parts of the code work together, and identify where new code can build on existing structures. From deciphering complex logic to pinpointing useful features and guiding implementation, NotebookLM transforms the way I interact with large codebases—making it easier and faster to harness their full potential.

For the purpose of this demo, I will use the repo of crewAI. crewAI is an agentic LLM framework. The repo is actually pretty well documented (https://docs.crewai.com/introduction), so this might be useful for repo that don't have that level of documentation.

# Making the code Chat-Ready

To interact with a large codebase using NotebookLM, the first step is transforming the code into a format that the tool can efficiently process. NotebookLM has specific limitations: it allows a maximum of 50 files per notebook, each capped at 500,000 words. While this capacity is ample for many text-based projects, a large repository with multiple files and thousands of lines of code can quickly surpass these limits.

To work within these constraints, I developed a script to convert an entire repository into NotebookLM-friendly text files. The script consolidates the contents of the repo, merging files into larger text files that contain structured comments and headers for easy navigation. This transformation ensures that all classes, functions, and dependencies are represented in a way that NotebookLM can digest—allowing me to interact with the full scope of the codebase without exceeding NotebookLM’s file and word limits.

The repo has the converted text files of the crewai repo as an example. 

# 8 Ways to "Chat" with the Code

First you upload the text files to your notebook.

Once the code is prepared for NotebookLM, it becomes an interactive guide through the repository, providing a range of helpful insights. Here are eight ways NotebookLM can assist in navigating, optimizing, and building on complex codebases.

1. Summarize All the Things

With NotebookLM, you can request high-level summaries of entire modules or drill down to specific functions. These summaries quickly reveal the purpose and function of different code sections, providing a clear map of what the repository offers without needing to manually review each part. It’s like getting a high-level overview combined with specific insights, helping you quickly assess the code’s capabilities and structure.

2. Onboarding and Learning Path Suggestions

NotebookLM can be a valuable tool for guiding beginners through a complex codebase with an onboarding path tailored to essential concepts and functions. By requesting an onboarding path, you can use NotebookLM to identify critical modules, functions, and dependencies in sequence, helping new team members navigate the repository in manageable steps. NotebookLM provides explanations of key classes and methods, often with relevant code snippets and usage examples, enabling beginners to understand each component’s role and interconnections within the codebase. This structured pathway allows newcomers to build foundational knowledge and gain hands-on familiarity with core functionalities, setting them up for success as they dive deeper into the project.

![prompt: Can you suggest an onboarding path for beginners or new team members to understand and work with this repository? Focus on the essential modules, functions, and dependencies, and provide clear learning steps with goals for each stage. Include specific code examples, key methods to explore, and practical checkpoints where they can test their understanding. If possible, suggest a small project or exercise for hands-on practice using the core functionalities.](readme/onboarding_path.png)

3. Generating Familiarization Code Snippets

You can use NotebookLM to generate a code example that helps you get familiar with a repository’s functionalities by requesting a small, practical implementation. For instance, simply ask, “implement a very simple example of a crew of agents”.
NotebookLM will reference the relevant parts of the codebase to provide an initial snippet, allowing you to see the function in action and understand how it interacts with other components, making it easier to start exploring and building on the repository’s capabilities.

4. Dependency Detective

Large codebases often involve intricate interdependencies, which can be challenging to untangle. NotebookLM can map out these relationships, providing a clear view of how different modules interact. By understanding data flow and function dependencies, you gain a deeper insight into how changes in one area may impact others, allowing for more informed development decisions.

![prompt: Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the dependencies between the agent and task modules in the CrewAI framework? Include specific function calls, methods, or data structures where agent relies on task for execution. Also, list any parameter exchanges or direct references in the code, and if possible, provide code snippets that illustrate these dependencies.”](readme/agent_task_dependencies.png)

5. Identifying Vulnerabilities

One valuable use case for NotebookLM is performing a security review on a codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment. By guiding NotebookLM to examine areas prone to risks—such as code injection points, access control mechanisms, data handling practices, and dependencies—it can help flag sections of the code that may need tightening. For example, NotebookLM might pinpoint functions with unsanitized inputs, highlight dependency versions with known vulnerabilities, or recommend stronger access controls on sensitive modules. With these insights, developers can proactively address weaknesses, making the repository safer and more robust before it goes live.

![prompt: Can you analyze this codebase for any security vulnerabilities that I should address before deploying? Specifically, look for risks related to code injection, inadequate access control, improper data handling, dependency vulnerabilities, and any other common security issues in repositories. Provide examples of code sections or functions that might need security improvements, along with recommendations for mitigating these risks.”](readme/crewai_vulnerabilities.png)

6. Feature Exploration Guide

NotebookLM can act as a feature exploration guide, outlining optional features, hidden modules, or “nice-to-have” functionalities within the codebase that might be less apparent. This is helpful for exploring the repo’s full potential and discovering lesser-used but valuable components.

![prompt: Can you provide a feature exploration guide for this codebase? Outline any optional features, hidden modules, or ‘nice-to-have’ functionalities that may not be immediately obvious but could be valuable. Include a brief description of each feature, its purpose, and examples of how it might enhance or extend the core functionalities of the codebase”](readme/crewai_feature_exploration.png)



4. New Feature Prototyping

For expanding the functionality of a codebase, NotebookLM can propose starter code for new features based on the existing structure. By understanding the current architecture and dependencies, it suggests how to implement new modules or functions that integrate seamlessly with existing components. This feature accelerates prototyping by providing a solid foundation to build on.




7. Code Classroom

NotebookLM is an excellent tool for educating and onboarding team members, as it explains complex code sections in digestible language. For new developers or collaborators, NotebookLM can act as a “code classroom,” breaking down functions and algorithms to ensure everyone understands the code’s purpose and functionality. This is invaluable for bringing team members up to speed quickly and ensuring cohesive collaboration.

Together, these features make NotebookLM a powerful conversational partner for navigating, improving, and expanding large repositories, turning code from an opaque resource into a manageable and insightful guide.
