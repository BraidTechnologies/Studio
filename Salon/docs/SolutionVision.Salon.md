**Solution Vision: Salon - AI-Powered Automation for Software Development**

**Vision Statement:**

Salon will be the leading **AI-powered full lifecycle toolset for software development**, enabling teams to rapidly analyse code and streamline engineering by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Salon will improve developer productivity, reduce time to delivery, and enhance the quality of software projects.

**Problem Statement:**

Software development teams face significant challenges in maintaining code quality and meeting deadlines. These challenges include:

*   **Slow Onboarding:** New team members often spend a lot of time getting up to speed with existing codebases.
*   **Time-Consuming Testing:** Writing comprehensive test suites is a laborious and time-intensive task, particularly for APIs and complex codebases.
*   **Integration Difficulties:** Ensuring that various tools and processes work together seamlessly can be a challenge.

**Solution Description:**

Salon addresses these challenges by providing a suite of AI-powered tools to automate key aspects of the software development lifecycle. It leverages LLMs to generate test code, analyse code, and improve the accessibility of codebases. The key features of Salon include:

*   **Code Analysis**: Salon includes a `repo_to_text` script that scans a directory system, concatenates code into text files, and supports a "Chat to your code" assistant, allowing developers to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand code, dependencies and design. Salon also includes `repo_to_C4`, which generates architecture diagrams from code in the 'C4' format (Context, Containers, Components, & Code).
*   **Automated Test Code Generation:** Salon uses the **OpenAI Assistant API** to generate test code for APIs, processing API definitions written in JSON and YAML formats to create Python test scripts. This significantly reduces the time and effort required to write test cases, improving test coverage and code quality. 
*   **Automated Evals for Generative AI applications:** Salon uses the **OpenAI Assistant API** to generate unit evalsfor AI code, based on simple core function, a purturbation that generates the same output, and a pertubation that generates differennt output. This significantly reduces the time and effort required to write evals, improving solution quality and consistency. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Enhanced Understanding of Codebases**: The `repo_to_text` and `repo_to_C4` tools allow developers to better understand large codebases, which significantly reduces the time it takes for new team members to get up to speed.
*   **Increased Development Speed:** Salon accelerates the software development lifecycle by automating time-consuming tasks, such as navigating large codebases and ensuring proper test coverage. 
*   **Improved Code Quality:** Automatically generated tests enhance test coverage and help identify bugs early in the development process.
*   **Focus on Automation:** Salon is designed to automate key aspects of the development process, freeing up developers to focus on more strategic work.
*   **Integration with LLMs:** By leveraging LLMs, Salon can offer actionable insights to lareg code bases. 'Chat to your code' makes it easier for team members to understand the code base and evaluate the approach to making changes. 
*   **Context-Aware Code Generation:** By providing machine-readable output, Salon provides context aware prompts for software tools such as GitHib Copilot or Cursor.ai, which results in even more useful and more relevant generated code.

**Target Users:**

*   Software developers
*   QA engineers
*   Anyone working with a large or complex codebase

**Future Vision:**

*   Enhanced code analysis capabilities, including dependency mapping and adherence to architecture standards.
*   Enhanced Data Visualisation: Explore more advanced visualisation techniques to present codebases in an easy-to-understand manner.
*   Integration with development tools.
*   Improved user interface to make tools more accessible and easy to use.

This solution vision should be used to guide ongoing development and enhancement of the Salon application to support Braid's business goals.
