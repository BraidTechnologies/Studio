1. **Definitions:**
   - **ISummariseRequest:** This is a JSON object with the following properties:
     - `text`: A required string property that represents the text to be summarized.
     - `lengthInWords`: An optional numeric property indicating the desired length of the summary in words.
   - **ISummariseResponse:** This is another JSON object with a required property:
     - `summary`: A string that holds the summarized text.

2. **Metadata:**
   - The file includes metadata such as `$id`, which identifies it as "SummariseApi.Types.json", and a `$comment` indicating it might have been generated from source code.

In summary, this specification outlines the structure of request and response objects for a summarization API. The request includes text to be summarized and optionally the desired length, while the response contains the resulting summary.
