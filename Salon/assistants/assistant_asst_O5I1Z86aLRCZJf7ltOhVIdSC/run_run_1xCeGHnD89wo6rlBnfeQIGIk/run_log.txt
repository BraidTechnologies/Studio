### Summarization API

#### Overview
The Summarization API is designed to process input text and generate a summarized version of the text. It takes a request object as input, which may include the text to be summarized and an optional parameter specifying the desired length of the summary in words. The API returns a response object containing the summarized text.

#### API Request

- **Request Object: `ISummariseRequest`**
  - **Fields:**
    - `text` (string, required): 
      - The text that needs to be summarized. This field is mandatory.
    - `lengthInWords` (number, optional):
      - Specifies the desired length of the summarized text in words. This field is optional; if not provided, the API will determine the length of the summary based on its logic.

  - **JSON Schema:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "text": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "ISummariseRequest.text"
        },
        "lengthInWords": {
          "type": "number",
          "title": "ISummariseRequest.lengthInWords"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "text"
      ],
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "title": "ISummariseRequest",
      "description": "Defines the structure of a summarise request object."
    }
    ```

#### API Response

- **Response Object: `ISummariseResponse`**
  - **Fields:**
    - `summary` (string, required):
      - The resulting summarized text based on the input provided.
  
  - **JSON Schema:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "summary": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "ISummariseResponse.summary"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "summary"
      ],
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "title": "ISummariseResponse",
      "description": "Defines the structure of a summarise response object."
    }
    ```

#### Usage
