Assistant says: The content of the file appears to be an API specification in JSON format, likely a JSON Schema, which describes the structure of JSON objects used in an API.

From the partial contents, we can deduce the following:

1. **ISummariseRequest**:
   - This is a JSON object representing a request to an API. 
   - It has fields:
     - `text`: A string that is required. It likely represents the text to be summarized.
     - `lengthInWords`: A number that indicates the desired length of the summary in words, though it's not marked as required.
   - It specifies that no additional properties are allowed, which means only the defined properties should exist in this object.

2. **ISummariseResponse**:
   - This is a JSON object representing the response from the API.
   - It includes one required field:
     - `summary`: A string that contains the summary of the input text.
   - Similarly, no additional properties are allowed.

This API specification describes a simple service that accepts text input (potentially to generate summaries of the text) and returns a string summary. It defines the request and response objects that must comply with specified constraints.
