**api_to_test_code.py**

This script generates Pytest code from API data provided in JSON or YAML formats.

**Important functions and their roles:**
- `parse_arguments()`: Parses command-line arguments to get the input file path.
- `extract_code(content: str)`: Extracts Python code snippets from the provided content between defined markers.
- `load_api_data(file_path: str)`: Loads API data from the specified JSON or YAML file and returns it as a dictionary.
- `main()`: Orchestrates the overall process, including parsing arguments, loading API data, generating code using an OpenAI assistant, and saving the generated code.

It logs errors, warnings, and information messages for debugging. Additionally, it initializes an OpenAI assistant to generate test codes from the API data.

**repo_to_text.py**

The `repo_to_text.py` script processes files in a local GitHub repository by concatenating their content into text files while observing a specified word limit per file. 

Key functions include `parse_arguments()` for parsing command-line arguments, `validate_args(args)` for ensuring the repository path and output directories are valid, and `load_yaml(fname)` for loading the configuration from YAML files.

Key classes are `SummarisedDirectory`, which stores the name and summary of directories, and `RepoContentProcessor`, which is the main class responsible for processing the repository's contents.

The script uses `summarise_code(source)` with an external API to condense source filesâ€™ content. It also employs patterns to exclude certain files or directories and leverages the NLTK library for word tokenization and the `requests` library for API calls.
