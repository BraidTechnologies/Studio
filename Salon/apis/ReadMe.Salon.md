**FindThemeApi.Types_test.py**

This code defines and validates JSON schemas for request and response using the `jsonschema` library and tests these schemas using the `pytest` framework.

The `IFindThemeRequestSchema` specifies a request schema requiring `text` as a string and `length` as a number, with no additional properties allowed.

The `IFindThemeResponseSchema` outlines a response schema needing a `theme` as a string, disallowing any extra properties.

There are also test functions to validate the adherence to schemas. Functions like `test_valid_ifind_theme_request`, `test_invalid_ifind_theme_request_missing_text`, etc., check for valid and different invalid payloads, ensuring exceptions are raised when validations fail.

**PagerepositoryApi.Types_test.py**

This code is designed for testing an API endpoint at `http://api.example.com/functions` using the `pytest` framework and `unittest.mock` for mocking. 

The `test_get_page_success` function tests a successful request with a dummy parameter, verifying a 200 status code and checking the response contains the expected HTML content.

The `test_get_page_missing_param` function tests an unsuccessful request due to a missing required parameter, expecting a 400 status code and an appropriate error message in the response.

The important methods in this module are `test_get_page_success` and `test_get_page_missing_param`.
