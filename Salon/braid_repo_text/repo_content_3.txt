This module belongs to the `TestForSummariseFailApi` and handles the data types and interfaces required for summary validation.

The interface `ITestForSummariseFailRequest` defines the structure of a summarise request, including mandatory `text` and an optional `lengthInWords`.

The `ETestForSummariseFail` is an enumeration that lists possible validation results: `kSummaryFailed` and `kSummarySucceeded`.

The `ITestForSummariseFailResponse` interface defines the structure of a summarise response, which includes the validation result of type `ETestForSummariseFail`.

These types ensure type-safe validation of summaries within the `TestForSummariseFailApi` module.

**ThemeApi.ts**

The given code is part of the `ThemeApi` module developed by Braid Technologies Ltd. It provides type definitions and interfaces for detecting and analyzing themes in textual content.

The `IFindThemeRequest` interface specifies the structure of a request for theme detection. It includes two properties: `text`, which is the content to be analyzed, and `length`, which likely represents the length of the text or a relevant parameter for the theme-finding algorithm.

These type definitions ensure that the theme-related operations are type-safe, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.
