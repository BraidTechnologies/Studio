**chunk_repository_test.py**

The code snippet is testing a database API focusing on the `ChunkRepository` class. It sets up basic logging for debugging purposes.

The `test_basic()` function checks that a `ChunkRepository` instance can be created successfully. 

The `test_does_not_exist()` function verifies that a non-existent file does not appear in the repository.

The `test_save()` function tests saving a pre-defined chunk, `master_chunk`, to the repository.

The `test_save_exists()` function checks if the chunk can be successfully saved and its existence can be confirmed.

The `test_save_find()` function verifies that a saved chunk can be loaded and its properties match the original.

**page_repository_test.py**

This code is a test suite for the `PageRepository` class in the `DB API`.

- The `PageRepository` and `make_page_from_file` functions are imported from `src.page_repository_api`.
- The script sets up the test environment, adjusts the system path for importing modules, and configures logging.
- A `page` object is created using `make_page_from_file`.

The following test functions are defined:
- `test_basic()`: Tests the basic construction of a `PageRepository` object.
- `test_does_not_exist()`: Checks if a non-existent page load returns `False`.
- `test_save()`: Verifies that a `page` can be saved.
- `test_save_load()`: Ensures that a saved `page` can also be loaded successfully.
