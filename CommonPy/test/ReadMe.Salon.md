**chunk_repository_test.py**

This script contains tests for the `ChunkRepository` class from the `chunk_repository_api` module.

The setup includes importing necessary libraries, configuring the `sys.path` to include the source directory, and setting up logging to capture error messages.

Several essential data structures are instantiated, including `embedding` (an instance of `IStoredEmbedding`), `summary`, and `title` (both instances of `IStoredTextRendering`), and `master_chunk` (an instance of `IStoredChunk`).

The tests defined are:
1. `test_basic`: Ensures the `ChunkRepository` can be instantiated without errors.
2. `test_does_not_exist`: Verifies that a non-existent path returns false on existence check.
3. `test_save`: Checks that a chunk can be saved successfully.
4. `test_save_exists`: Confirms that a saved chunk can be checked for existence.
5. `test_save_find`: Ensures that a saved chunk can be correctly loaded and its data verified.

Classes and functions involved:
- `ChunkRepository`
- `IStoredChunk`
- `IStoredEmbedding`
- `IStoredTextRendering`
- `test_basic`
- `test_does_not_exist`
- `test_save`
- `test_save_exists`
- `test_save_find`.

**page_repository_test.py**

This code tests a Database (DB) API, specifically focusing on the "PageRepository" class and "make_page_from_file" function.

It sets up the necessary imports and configurations, including setting up paths and extending 'sys.path' for module access.

Logging is set up to display error-level messages for debugging purposes.

A page object is created using the "make_page_from_file" function.

The `test_basic` function verifies construction of a PageRepository instance.

The `test_does_not_exist` function checks that loading a non-existent page fails.

The `test_save` function tests saving a page to the repository.

The `test_save_load` function ensures a saved page can be loaded back from the repository.
