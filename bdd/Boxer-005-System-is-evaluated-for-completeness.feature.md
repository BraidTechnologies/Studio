**As a user, I want a system that has been evaluated for completeness of coverage so I can be confident in getting a good anwser to my questions**.

### Scenario: System Coverage Evaluation
**Given** I have a set of test questions covering different AI topics  
**When** I submit these questions to the system  
**Then** each question receives a relevant answer  
**And** the answers are backed by source documentation  
**And** the system's coverage metrics meet defined thresholds

### Scenario: Identifying Coverage Gaps
**Given** the system processes a new question  
**When** there is insufficient source material to provide a complete answer  
**Then** the system acknowledges the limitation  
**And** indicates which aspects of the question it cannot fully address

### Scenario: Coverage Improvement Over Time
**Given** a gap in coverage has been identified  
**When** new relevant content is added to the system  
**Then** the system can now provide complete answers for previously incomplete topics  
**And** the overall coverage metrics improve
