Cascade is an Edge plug in that uses simple BraidAPi calls to summarise and classify the current page of the browser. This is intended as a technology demonstrator for enterprise use cases like a ticket summariser - you can imagine a fron end in a ticketing system where you first summarise status then close the ticket. Cascade also shows multi-language processesing - summaries are shown in English, granslated from the source language.
