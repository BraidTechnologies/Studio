 * @module ChunkRepositoryApi.Types
 * @description Defines the core data types and interfaces for the ChunkRepository API.
 * This module contains type definitions for chunks, embeddings, and text renderings used
 * throughout the chunk storage system. It includes interfaces for storing and managing
 * text fragments with their associated metadata, embeddings, and relationships.
 *
 * Key components:
 * - IStoredEmbedding: For storing vector embeddings with their model ID
 * - IStoredTextRendering: For storing text generations with their model ID
 * - IStoredChunk: The main chunk interface that combines text, embeddings, and metadata
