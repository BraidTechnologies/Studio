**activitystore.test.ts**

This code is a Mocha test suite that tests the behavior of a storage system with the `ActivityRepositoryApi`.

The `describe` function is used to define a set of related tests under the name "StorableActivity". 

There are three test cases, each implemented using the `it` function:

1. "Needs to succeed with valid key" tests the function `saveLoadRemove` to ensure data can be saved, loaded, and removed with a valid session key.
2. "Needs to fail with invalid key" tests the function `failSave` to ensure the operation fails with an invalid session key.
3. "Needs to pull multiple records with valid key" tests the retrieval of multiple stored records using a query specification.

Key classes and functions:
- `getEnvironment`
- `ActivityRepositoryApi`
- `randomKey`
- `saveLoadRemove`
- `failSave`

**checksession.test.ts**

This JavaScript code imports necessary modules and sets the environment as strict for secure programming.

It uses Mocha for describing and running test cases and Expect for writing assertions.

The `describe` function names the test suite "CheckSession" and its nested `it` functions describe individual test cases.

Four test cases are defined:
1. Test for success with a valid key in the local environment.
2. Test for success with a valid key in the production environment.
3. Test for failure with an invalid key in the local environment.
4. Test for failure with an invalid key in the production environment.

`SessionApi` and `getEnvironment` are key functions/classes used for creating API instances and getting the appropriate environment settings. `checkSessionKey` method validates the session key. Each test has a timeout setting of 20 seconds.

**chunk.test.ts**

This code is a test suite for chunking text, implemented using Mocha and Expect. Tests are organized within the `describe` block named "Chunk".

The `validChunkCall` function sends a POST request with a text chunk request and processes the response. It returns an `IChunkResponse` object if successful, otherwise returns `undefined`.

The `invalidChunkCall` function sends a GET request which is expected to fail, catching any errors and returning `true` if an error occurs, otherwise `false`.

The `it` blocks define three tests. The first checks if a request with an incorrect session key fails. The second checks if a short message can be chunked into one part. The third test checks if a longer message is chunked into multiple parts.

Important classes/functions:
1. `validChunkCall`
2. `invalidChunkCall`
3. Mocha’s `describe` and `it` functions for test definition.

**chunkstore.test.ts**

**classify.test.ts**

This module performs tests on a classification API using Mocha and Axios. It defines several test cases to validate the API’s behavior under different circumstances, such as incorrect session keys and correct classification of various messages.

The `validClassifyCall` function sends a classification request to the API and returns the classification if successful.

The `invalidClassifyCall` function checks if an incorrect API call returns an error.

Test cases are defined using `describe` and `it` from Mocha, leveraging `expect` for assertions.

The environment is fetched using the `getEnvironment` function, which adjusts the API URL based on the environment type (local or production).

**Important functions and classes:**
- `validClassifyCall`
- `invalidClassifyCall`

**embed.test.ts**

This module is a test suite for the "Embed" functionality using Mocha and Expect for testing, and Axios for making HTTP requests. It includes helper functions `validEmbedCall` and `invalidEmbedCall` for making API requests and handling their responses.

The module retrieves the environment configuration via `getEnvironment` from `../../CommonTs/src/IEnvironmentFactory` and uses types like `IEmbedRequest` and `IEmbedResponse` from `../../CommonTs/src/EmbedApi.Types`.

The test cases:
1. Validate API failure with incorrect session keys in local and production environments.
2. Validate successful embedding of simple and long messages by sending POST requests to the embed API with valid session keys.

Important functions:
1. `validEmbedCall`
2. `invalidEmbedCall`

**environment.test.ts**

The code starts with a 'strict mode' declaration to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript.

It imports the `expect` function from the `expect` library for assertions, and `describe` and `it` functions from the `mocha` testing framework to structure the tests.

Two functions, `getEnvironment` and `getDefaultEnvironment`, and an enumeration `EEnvironment`, are imported from a common library.

The `describe` block defines a test suite named "Environment".

Inside the suite, an `it` block specifies a test case to check if the default environment is local in the Mocha testing environment.

The test asserts that the names of the default environment and the local environment are the same.

**findenrichedchunks.test.ts**

This code defines and runs a series of tests using Mocha and Expect. It imports necessary modules such as `getEnvironment` and `FindEnrichedChunkApi`.

The `commonChunkStoreTests` function is an asynchronous test suite that takes a repository, summaries, and URLs. It contains three tests: 
1. `Needs to find relevant chunks from a matching Summary` - Tests if the function finds relevant pieces of chunks from summaries.
2. `Needs to find relevant chunks from a matching URL` - Tests if the function finds relevant pieces of chunks from URLs.
3. `Needs to find same chunks from a matching URL` - Tests whether identical chunks are found from the URL.

Then, two `describe` blocks (`FindEnrichedChunks - Boxer` and `FindEnrichedChunks - Waterfall`) execute `commonChunkStoreTests` with different sets of summaries and URLs for the Boxer and Waterfall repositories.

**findtheme.test.ts**

This code is setting up a Mocha testing suite to validate theme extraction using API calls. It imports necessary modules like `expect`, `describe`, `it` from `mocha`, and `axios` for HTTP requests. 

`validThemeCall` asynchronously sends a POST request with the text and length to a specified API URL and returns the theme extracted from the response. 

`invalidThemeCall` asynchronously sends a GET request to a specified API URL and returns true if an error occurs.

Several test cases check the theme extraction functionality under different conditions (e.g., correct/incorrect session keys) using these helper functions. 

Important functions are `validThemeCall` and `invalidThemeCall`.

**generatefluidtoken.test.ts**

- The code is a test suite that verifies the functionality of generating and handling Fluid tokens and connecting to Fluid containers.
- The `describe` function groups the tests related to "Generate Fluid Token."
- The `it` functions are used to define individual test cases:
  1. "Needs to fail if session key is incorrect" ensures token generation fails with an incorrect session key.
  2. "Needs to return a valid token if session key is correct" ensures token generation succeeds with a correct session key in a local environment.
  3. "Needs to return a valid token from production if session key is correct" ensures token generation succeeds with a correct session key in a production environment.
  4. "Needs to connect to a Fluid container" tests creating and connecting to a Fluid container through AzureClient.
- Important classes/functions:
  - `getEnvironment` from `../../CommonTs/src/IEnvironmentFactory`,
  - `FluidApi` from `../../CommonTs/src/FluidApi`,
  - `AzureClient` from `@fluidframework/azure-client`,
  - `SharedString` from `fluid-framework/legacy`,
  - `sleep` helper function for delay,
  - Test framework functions from `expect` and `mocha`.

**login.test.ts**

This code is a set of tests using Mocha and Expect to verify the functionality of a login system. 

The `LoginApi` class is tested in different environments (local and production) with both valid and invalid session keys.

The `describe` function from Mocha groups the tests under the "Login" name.
Each `it` function defines an individual test case and verifies the expected behavior using the `expect` assertion library. 

Four test cases are included:
1. Successful login with a valid session key in the local environment.
2. Failed login with an invalid session key in the local environment.
3. Successful login with a valid session key in the production environment.
4. Failed login with an invalid session key in the production environment.

Each test is given a timeout of 20,000 milliseconds to allow for longer network operations.

**model.test.ts**

This module contains a series of tests for the `Model` class using the Mocha testing framework. The `describe` function groups these tests under the "Model" label.

The first test verifies that the default model provided by the `getDefaultModel()` function has a non-empty `deploymentName` and a positive `contextWindowSize`.

The next test checks that the `getModel(EModel.kSmall)` function returns a specific model with a non-empty `deploymentName` and a positive `contextWindowSize`.

Subsequent tests assess the model's ability to judge whether small and large texts fit within its context using the `fitsInContext` method.

Further tests evaluate the model's `chunkText` method to ensure it correctly chunks both small and large texts, with and without overlaps.

Important functions in this module are `getDefaultModel` and `getModel` from `IModelFactory`, and the testing functions from the Mocha framework (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).

**pagestore.test.ts**

This code is a test module for verifying the functionality of the `StorablePage` feature in a local environment.

**Important Functions:**
- `loadHtmlFromFile`: Reads HTML content from a specified file, returns it as a string, or throws an error if the file cannot be read.

**Tests (using Mocha and Expect):**
- **describe("StorablePage")**: Contains two tests that run in a local environment.
  - **it("Needs to succeed with save & valid key in local environment")**: Tests saving a record using `PageRepositoryApi` and ensures the save operation returns true.
  - **it("Needs to succeed with load & valid key in local environment")**: Tests loading the saved HTML page from the API endpoint and verifies it matches the original HTML content.

**Dependencies:**
- `axios`, `expect`, `mocha`: Used for making HTTP requests, assertions, and structuring tests.
- Custom modules like `randomKey`, `EEnvironment`, `getEnvironment`, `PageRepositoryApi`, and types from `PageRepositoryApi.Types`.

**querymodel.test.ts**

This code tests a QueryModel API for generating responses and questions related to generative AI. It contains three primary tests.

The `describe` block specifies a suite named "QueryModel." 

The `it` function defines three test cases: "Needs to make a simple query," "Needs to make a query with history," and "Needs to generate questions based on a summary." 

The `QueryModelApi` class is used to interact with the API, making use of methods `queryModelWithEnrichment` and `generateQuestion`. 

Environment settings, session keys, and user prompts are defined as inputs to the API. 

Assertions check if the API responses are defined and contain expected data.

**storable.ts**

The code defines three key functions: `randomInt`, `randomKey`, and three asynchronous functions for interaction with `IStorableRepostoryApiWrapper` API: `saveLoadRemove`, `saveFindRemove`, and `failSave`.

The `randomInt` function generates a random integer between `min` and `max`, while `randomKey` creates a string key using the `randomInt` function.

The `saveLoadRemove` function tests saving, loading, then removing a record via the `api`, asserting that each operation returns the expected result.

Similarly, `saveFindRemove` tests saving, finding, and removing a record, using `functionalSearchKey` for finding.

The `failSave` function ensures that an attempt to save a record returns `false`.

**summarise.test.ts**

This code is a set of Mocha tests that validate the functionality of an API for summarizing text. 

The `describe` block named "Summarise" contains test cases to validate the API under various conditions. It uses the `it` function to define individual test cases.

The helper function `validSummaryCall` makes a POST request to the API to get a summary and returns the summary text.

The helper function `invalidSummaryCall` makes an invalid API request to check for error handling and returns whether an error was caught.

Important classes and functions:  
1. `describe`  
2. `it`  
3. `validSummaryCall`  
4. `invalidSummaryCall`  

The tests include scenarios for both local and production environments, using the `getEnvironment` function to set up the environment. They check for correct failures and successful summaries given different API calls.

**testforsummarisefail.test.ts**

This code tests the summarization failure responses of an API. It uses Mocha as the testing framework and Axios for HTTP requests.

Main functions include `validCall` which makes a POST request to the API to test valid input and `invalidCall` which tests the API's handling of invalid sessions by making a GET request.

The tests cover different scenarios including:
1. Validating that the API catches incorrect session keys and returns an error.
2. Ensuring that the API returns correct failure codes for predefined text inputs deemed unable to summarize.
3. Repeating these checks for both local and production environments.

Important modules: `describe`, `it` from Mocha, `validCall`, `invalidCall`.
