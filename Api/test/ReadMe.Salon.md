**activitystore.test.ts**

This code is a test suite for the `StorableActivity` module using Mocha and Expect libraries.

The suite involves three tests: 
1. Verifies if a record can be successfully saved, loaded, and removed using a valid key with `saveLoadRemove` function.
2. Ensures the `failSave` function returns true when using invalid session key.
3. Checks the ability to pull multiple records with a valid key using `ActivityRepostoryApi`.

The `IStorable` and `IStorableMultiQuerySpec` interfaces define the record and query specifications, while `randomKey`, `saveLoadRemove`, `failSave`, and `getEnvironment` functions assist in test setups. The `ActivityRepostoryApi` interacts with the environment.

Important functions and classes:
- `describe`
- `it`
- `randomKey`
- `saveLoadRemove`
- `failSave`
- `ActivityRepostoryApi`
- `getEnvironment`
- `IStorable`
- `IStorableMultiQuerySpec`

**checksession.test.ts**

This code is a test module utilizing Mocha and Expect for testing session validation of the `SessionApi` class.

The `describe` function wraps the tests for session validation under the "CheckSession" suite. 

The `it` function contains individual test cases: 

1. It first verifies the session key succeeds in a local environment.
2. Then, it ensures the session key works in a production environment.
3. One test checks that an invalid session key fails in a local environment.
4. Another test confirms the failure of an invalid session key in a production environment.

Important classes and functions are `SessionApi`, `describe`, and `it`. These tests simulate function calls based on different environments retrieved by `getEnvironment` and validate outcomes using `expect`.

**chunk.test.ts**

This code is a test suite using Mocha and Expect for testing chunk API calls. The tests are defined within the `describe` block, which is focused on "Chunk" operations.

The **`validChunkCall`** function sends a POST request to the provided API URL with the given text and returns a chunk response. 

The **`invalidChunkCall`** function sends a GET request to the provided API URL, expects it to fail, and returns a Boolean indicating whether an error was caught.

The first test, defined by an `it` block, expects the chunk API call to fail using an incorrect session key.

The second test verifies that a short text message can be successfully chunked.

The third test verifies that a long text message (created by repeating the sample text) can be successfully chunked into multiple chunks.

Key functions: `validChunkCall`, `invalidChunkCall`.

Key libraries: `expect`, `mocha`, `axios`.

Key modules: `IEnvironmentFactory`, `EEnvironment`, `ChunkApi.Types`.

**chunkstore.test.ts**

This code is a test suite for the `StorableChunk` module using Mocha and Expect libraries. 

The `describe` function defines a test suite named "StorableChunk". 

Within the suite, a sample record (of type `IStoredChunk`) is defined with properties like `id`, `applicationId`, and `userId`, among others.

An environment is established using `getEnvironment` and an API instance is created with `ChunkRepostoryApi`.

The `afterEach` function is used to clean up temporary test objects created during each test.

Three test cases are defined using `it`; each ensures correct functioning of save, load, and remove operations (`saveLoadRemove`, `saveFindRemove`) and a failure case for saving with an invalid key (`failSave`). 

Key functions and classes are `saveLoadRemove`, `saveFindRemove`, `failSave`, `ChunkRepostoryApi`, and `IStoredChunk`.
