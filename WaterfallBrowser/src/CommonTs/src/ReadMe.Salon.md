`StorableRepostoryApi` is used internally for making API calls.

**Api.ts**

This module defines an `Api` class which serves as a base class for APIs interacting with a specified environment. The class utilizes a provided session key for authentication.

- The class imports `axios` for handling HTTP requests and `IEnvironment` to define the environment interface.

- The `Api` constructor accepts an `IEnvironment` object and a session key, storing them in private fields `_environment` and `_sessionKey`, respectively.

- The class provides getter methods `environment` and `sessionKey` to access these private fields.

Key components:
- `Api` class
- Constructor: `public constructor(environemnt_: IEnvironment, sessionKey_: string)`
- Getter methods: `public get environment()`, `public get sessionKey()`

**Asserts.ts**

This module aids input validation using three specialized functions.

The `throwIfUndefined` function checks if a given value is `undefined`. When `x` is `undefined`, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Object is undefined.".

The `throwIfNull` function checks if a given value is `null`. When `x` is `null`, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Object is null.".

The `throwIfFalse` function checks if a given boolean value is `false`. If it is `false`, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Value is false.".

Key class imported: `AssertionFailedError`. Important functions: `throwIfUndefined`, `throwIfNull`, `throwIfFalse`.

**Compress.ts**

This code module provides utility functions to compress and decompress strings using the `deflate` algorithm with the help of the `pako` library.

The `compressString` function takes a string, converts it to a `Uint8Array`, compresses it using `pako.deflate`, and then encodes the compressed data into a Base64 string. The encoding process adapts to both Node.js and browser environments.

The `decompressString` function reverses the process. It takes a Base64 encoded compressed string, decodes it into a `Uint8Array`, decompresses it using `pako.inflate`, and then converts the result back into the original string. Error handling is included for invalid input.

Important functions:
- `compressString`
- `decompressString`

**EmbedApi.Types.ts**

This code defines TypeScript interfaces for the Embed API data elements provided by Braid Technologies Ltd.

**Environment.ts**

This module defines three classes: `DevelopmentEnvironment`, `StagingEnvironment`, and `ProductionEnvironment`.

Each class implements the `IEnvironment` interface and represents a different environment configuration for API endpoint URL settings. 

The `DevelopmentEnvironment` class uses local URLs (`http://localhost`) for endpoints.

The `StagingEnvironment` and `ProductionEnvironment` classes use the same URLs (`https://braid-api.azurewebsites.net`) for their endpoints, but `StagingEnvironment` may have additional staging-specific endpoints and configurations 

Each class includes methods such as `checkSessionApi`, `summariseApi`, `classifyApi`, among others, to fetch corresponding API endpoints.

These classes centralize endpoint configurations for different environments, ensuring URLs can easily be managed and switched between development, staging, and production.

**Errors.ts**

This module defines several custom error classes for specific error scenarios:

- `InvalidParameterError`, `InvalidOperationError`, `InvalidStateError`, `ConnectionError`, `EnvironmentError`, and `AssertionFailedError` extend the native JavaScript `Error` class.

The module ensures that the prototype chain is correctly set, so the stack traces display accurately. Each custom error class takes an optional message parameter and logs the error details using either `logCoreError` or `logApiError`.

The `InvalidParameterError`, `InvalidOperationError`, `InvalidStateError`, `EnvironmentError`, and `AssertionFailedError` use `logCoreError`, while `ConnectionError` uses `logApiError` for logging purposes.

It includes a `name` property and multiple method signatures related to API endpoints, including methods for session checking, summarization, theme finding, chunk and activity management, LinkedIn authentication, generating questions, handling enriched chunks, and Fluid operations.

No actual implementations of these methods are provided, only their signatures.

Key components are the `EEnvironment` enumeration and `IEnvironment` interface.

**IEnvironmentFactory.ts**

The code defines functions to determine the appropriate environment configuration for a given execution context within an application.

`getDefaultEnvironment()` determines the environment based on whether it's running in Node.js and the value of `process.env.BRAID_ENVIRONMENT`. It will default to a `DevelopmentEnvironment` if running locally, else it defaults to `ProductionEnvironment`.

`getDefaultFluidEnvironment()` and `getDefaultLoginEnvironment()` extend the logic in `getDefaultEnvironment()` by checking if the context is a browser and if the hostname is 'localhost', in which case they return `DevelopmentEnvironment`.
