This module defines a base class named `Api` that facilitates interaction with various APIs.

The `Api` class requires an environment interface (`IEnvironment`) and a session key for authentication. These are passed as parameters to its constructor and stored as private properties `_environment` and `_sessionKey`.

The class provides public getter methods, `environment` and `sessionKey`, to access these properties.

The module imports the `axios` library for making HTTP requests, though there are no methods implemented in this base class utilizing `axios`.

The `Api` class is designed to be a superclass, meaning more specific API classes will extend it to implement their own unique functionality.
