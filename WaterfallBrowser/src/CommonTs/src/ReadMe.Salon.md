**ActivityRepositoryApi.ts**

The `ActivityRepositoryApi` class extends `Api` and implements `IStorableRepostoryApiWrapper` to interact with the activity repository API. It requires an `IEnvironment` instance and a session key for initialization, which are used for authentication and API URL configurations.

`ActivityRepositoryApi` contains methods: 
- `save(record: IStorable)`: Asynchronously saves the provided record to the activity API.
- `remove(recordId: string)`: Asynchronously removes a record by its ID.
- `load(recordId: string)`: Asynchronously retrieves a record by its ID.
- `find(functionalSearchKey: string)`: Asynchronously finds a record by a functional search key.
- `recent(querySpec: IStorableMultiQuerySpec)`: Asynchronously retrieves recent records based on certain query specifications.

The `StorableRepositoryApi` is utilized for method implementations such as saving, removing, loading, and retrieving recent records. The API URL is constructed by appending the session key for securing the requests.

**Api.ts**

The code defines an `Api` class used for interacting with a specified environment using a session key. 

The class imports `axios` for HTTP requests and an `IEnvironment` interface from a different module.

It has two private properties: `_environment` to hold the environment interface and `_sessionKey` for authentication.

The constructor initializes these properties based on provided arguments.

Getter methods `environment` and `sessionKey` are available to access the private properties.

The `Api` class itself is a base class, meant to be extended by more specific API classes.

Key classes/functions: `Api`, constructor, `environment`, `sessionKey`.

**Asserts.ts**

This module defines three functions to assert non-null, non-undefined, and truthy values.

### Functions:
- `throwIfUndefined`: This function checks if its argument `x` is `undefined`. If so, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Object is undefined."
- `throwIfNull`: This function checks if its argument `x` is `null`. If so, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Object is null."
- `throwIfFalse`: This function checks if its argument `x` is false. If so, it throws an `AssertionFailedError` with the message "Value is false."

### Important Class:

**Compress.ts**

This code module provides two main functions, `compressString` and `decompressString`, using the `pako` library to handle data compression and decompression.

The `compressString` function takes a string input, converts it to a `Uint8Array`, compresses it using the `pako.deflate` method, and then encodes the compressed data into a Base64 string, handling both Node.js and browser environments.

The `decompressString` function reverses the process. It decodes a Base64-encoded string into a `Uint8Array`, decompresses it using the `pako.inflate` method, and converts the decompressed data back into a string.

Both functions manage environmental differences in encoding and decoding.

**EmbedApi.Types.ts**
