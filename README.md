## General Information

This repo contains Braid's pattern applications, for use by Braid's clients. Click [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/1c1a155f-8c18-4e66-abd3-9c73b85f024c/audio?pli=1) for an audio overview generated by NotebookLM.

The first pattern is '**Waterfall**'. Waterfall is a text analyser / classifier, build to illustrate a possible ticket-classification system for Braid's clients. It illustrates the following:

- **Cascade** (a small waterfall) - an Edge plug in, that scrapes the current web page test, summarises it, and then classifies the text into one of Business, Technology, Sport, Health, or Politics. This is the 'Cascade' directory. Cascade is written in typescript/javascript. 

- **Waterfall** - a data analysis back end pipeline. This illustrates a date pipline to download web pages, summarise them, and then use cluster analysis to find the most common topics. This is the 'Waterfall' directory. Waterfall is written in Python. 

'**Api**' contains Azure functions that make calls to an Azure hosted OpenAI model to summrise and classify text. Waterfall, Cascade, and Boxer all call Braid Apis for any function requiring server side keys (database or AI model access).

'**ApiTest**' - code generated by Salon to test the Apis from Python classes.

'**CommonTs**' contains typescript utility classes used across both clients & server - especially API definitions and Types used to generate test scripts. Both subsystems are written in Typescript. Both Cascade and Waterfall make calls to the Apis.

'**CommonPy**' contains Python utility classes used to access the typescript server Apis and to hold common code used in multiple apps.

'**Salon**' - (a place where you do Braiding) is a set of scripts to help the engineering process. One script uses the OpenAI Assistant API to generate test code. It processes API definitions written in JSON and generates Python code to test them. The resulting code is in the 'ApiTest' directory. The second script, repo_to_text, scans a directory system and procduces a set of text files containing concatenated code. These files can be loaded into almost any LLM, to use for a 'Chat to your code' assistant. 

'**Boxer**', an AI-enabled learning assistant to help developers build generative AI applications more quickly.  It is a full web front end that passes questions to an LLM, and then enriches them with links to relevant document chunks found in its database of useful material - the A16Z AI Cannon. 

'**Teams**' contains a Teams plug-in that brings Boxer & Waterfall into the teams environment.

'**BoxerEval**' - evals for Boxer. 

## **Technologies**

For front end development Braid uses Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using the Microsoft Fluent UI framework (https://react.fluentui.dev/). Tests are written in Mocha (https://mochajs.org/).

For data processing and AI evaluation, Braid uses Python (https://www.python.org/). Tests are written in Pytest (https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

Braid uses Azure for all processing. 

## **Key Components**

1. Document Processing Pipeline:
    - Web scraping (using Beautiful Soup)
    - Text summarization
    - Embedding generation
    - Cluster analysis

2. API Layer:
    - Summarization endpoints
    - Classification services
    - Embedding generation
    - RESTful architecture

3. Testing Framework:
    - Mocha for TypeScript/JavaScript
    - pytest for Python components
    - Automated test generation through Salon

## **Practices**
   
1. Code Organization
    - Core online functionality in TypeScript
    - Use Python for data processing 
    - Maintain clear separation between UI and core logic

2. Testing
    - Write tests for all new features
    - Maintain test coverage above 90%
    - Use appropriate testing frameworks (Mocha for TypeScript, pytest for Python)

3. Documentation
    - Document all public APIs
    - Keep README files updated
    - Include code comments for complex logic

4. Version Control
    - Follow Git branching strategy
    - Write meaningful commit messages
    - Keep PRs focused and manageable
