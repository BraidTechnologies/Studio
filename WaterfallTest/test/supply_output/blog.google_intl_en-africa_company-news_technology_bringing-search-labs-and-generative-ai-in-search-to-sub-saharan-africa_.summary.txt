"Google is launching the Search Generative Experience (SGE) in Sub-Saharan Africa, using generative AI to provide comprehensive responses to open-ended questions. The company aims to cater to the diverse needs of users in the region. The SGE is an experimental feature in Search Labs, allowing users to provide feedback. Additionally, Google will be launching a new feature called \"search results about you\" to help users find information about themselves more easily."
