This powerful combination of the latest models and cutting-edge tooling empowers developers to create highly-customized solutions grounded in their organization’s data. That’s why we are excited to announce several updates to help developers quickly create AI solutions with greater choice and flexibility leveraging the Azure AI toolchain:\n\nImprovements to the Phi family of models, including a new Mixture of Experts (MoE) model and 20+ languages.\n\n\nAI21 Jamba 1.5 Large and Jamba 1.5 on Azure AI models as a service.\n\n\nIntegrated vectorization in Azure AI Search to create a streamlined retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with integrated data prep and embedding.\n\n\nCustom generative extraction models in Azure AI Document Intelligence, so you can now extract custom fields for unstructured documents with high accuracy.\n\n\nThe general availability of Text to Speech (TTS) Avatar, a capability of Azure AI Speech service, which brings natural-sounding voices and photorealistic avatars to life, across diverse languages and voices, enhancing customer engagement and overall experience. \n\n\nThe general availability of the VS Code extension for Azure Machine Learning.\n\n\nThe general availability of Conversational PII Detection Service in Azure AI Language.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAzure AI\nWhere innovators are creating the future\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTry Azure for free today\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nUse the Phi model family with more languages and higher throughput \nWe are introducing a new model to the Phi family, Phi-3.5-MoE, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. This new model combines 16 smaller experts into one, which delivers improvements in model quality and lower latency. While the model is 42B parameters, since it is an MoE model it only uses 6.6B active parameters at a time, by being able to specialize a subset of the parameters (experts) during training, and then at runtime use the relevant experts for the task. This approach gives customers the benefit of the speed and computational efficiency of a small model with the domain knowledge and higher quality outputs of a larger model. Read more about how we used a Mixture of Experts architecture to improve Azure AI translation performance and quality.\nWe are also announcing a new mini model, Phi-3.5-mini. Both the new MoE model and the mini model are multi-lingual, supporting over 20 languages. The additional languages allow people to interact with the model in the language they are most comfortable using.\nEven with new languages the new mini model, Phi-3.5-mini, is still a tiny 3.8B parameters.\n\nCompanies like CallMiner, a conversational intelligence leader, are selecting and using Phi models for their speed, accuracy, and security.\n“CallMiner is constantly innovating and evolving our conversation intelligence platform, and we’re excited about the value Phi models are bringing to our GenAI architecture. As we evaluate different models, we’ve continued to prioritize accuracy, speed, and security... The small size of Phi models makes them incredibly fast, and fine tuning has allowed us to tailor to the specific use cases that matter most to our customers at high accuracy and across multiple languages. Further, the transparent training process for Phi models empowers us to limit bias and implement GenAI securely. We look forward to expanding our application of Phi models across our suite of products“—Bruce McMahon, CallMiner’s Chief Product Officer.\nTo make outputs more predictable and define the structure needed by an application, we are bringing Guidance to the Phi-3.5-mini serverless endpoint. Guidance is a proven open-source Python library (with 18K plus GitHub stars) that enables developers to express in a single API call the precise programmatic constraints the model must follow for structured output in JSON, Python, HTML, SQL, whatever the use case requires. With Guidance, you can eliminate expensive retries, and can, for example, constrain the model to select from pre-defined lists (e.g., medical codes), restrict outputs to direct quotes from provided context, or follow in any regex. Guidance steers the model token by token in the inference stack, producing higher quality outputs and reducing cost and latency by as much as 30-50% when utilizing for highly structured scenarios. \n\nRead more about the benefits of Guidance.\n\nWe are also updating the Phi vision model with multi-frame support. This means that Phi-3.5-vision (4.2B parameters) allows reasoning over multiple input images unlocking new scenarios like identifying differences between images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the core of our product strategy, Microsoft is dedicated to supporting the development of safe and responsible AI, and provides developers with a robust suite of tools and capabilities.  \nDevelopers working with Phi models can assess quality and safety using both built-in and custom metrics using Azure AI evaluations, informing necessary mitigations. Azure AI Content Safety provides built-in controls and guardrails, such as prompt shields and protected material detection. These capabilities can be applied across models, including Phi, using content filters or can be easily integrated into applications through a single API. Once in production, developers can monitor their application for quality and safety, adversarial prompt attacks, and data integrity, making timely interventions with the help of real-time alerts. \nIntroducing AI21 Jamba 1.5 Large and Jamba 1.5 on Azure AI models as a service\nFurthering our goal to provide developers with access to the broadest selection of models, we are excited to also announce two new open models, Jamba 1.5 Large and Jamba 1.5, available in the Azure AI model catalog. These models use the Jamba architecture, blending Mamba, and Transformer layers for efficient long-context processing.\nAccording to AI21, the Jamba 1.5 Large and Jamba 1.5 models are the most advanced in the Jamba series. These models utilize the Hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, which balances speed, memory, and quality by employing Mamba layers for short-range dependencies and Transformer layers for long-range dependencies. Consequently, this family of models excels in managing extended contexts ideal for industries including financial services, healthcare, and life sciences, as well as retail and CPG. \n“We are excited to deepen our collaboration with Microsoft, bringing the cutting-edge innovations of the Jamba Model family to Azure AI users…As an advanced hybrid SSM-Transformer (Structured State Space Model-Transformer) set of foundation models, the Jamba model family democratizes access to efficiency, low latency, high quality, and long-context handling. These models empower enterprises with enhanced performance and seamless integration with the Azure AI platform”— Pankaj Dugar, Senior Vice President and General Manger of North America at AI21\n\nLearn more on the Jamba model family.\n\nSimplify RAG for generative AI applications\nWe are streamlining RAG pipelines with integrated, end to end data preparation and embedding. Organizations often use RAG in generative AI applications to incorporate knowledge on private organization specific data, without having to retrain the model. With RAG, you can use strategies like vector and hybrid retrieval to surface relevant, informed information to a query, grounded on your data. However, to perform vector search, significant data preparation is required. Your app must ingest, parse, enrich, embed, and index data of various types, often living in multiple sources, just so that it can be used in your copilot. \nToday we are announcing general availability of integrated vectorization in Azure AI Search. Integrated vectorization automates and streamlines these processes all into one flow. With automatic vector indexing and querying using integrated access to embedding models, your application unlocks the full potential of what your data offers.\nIn addition to improving developer productivity, integration vectorization enables organizations to offer turnkey RAG systems as solutions for new projects, so teams can quickly build an application specific to their datasets and need, without having to build a custom deployment each time.\nCustomers like SGS & Co, a global brand impact group, are streamlining their workflows with integrated vectorization.\n“SGS AI Visual Search is a GenAI application built on Azure for our global production teams to more effectively find sourcing and research information pertinent to their project… The most significant advantage offered by SGS AI Visual Search is utilizing RAG, with Azure AI Search as the retrieval system, to accurately locate and retrieve relevant assets for project planning and production”—Laura Portelli, Product Manager, SGS & Co\n\nLearn more on vectorization.\n\nExtract custom fields in Document Intelligence \nYou can now extract custom fields for unstructured documents with high accuracy by building and training a custom generative model within Document Intelligence. This new ability uses generative AI to extract user specified fields from documents across a wide variety of visual templates and document types. You can get started with as few as five training documents. While building a custom generative model, automatic labeling saves time and effort on manual annotation, results will display as grounded where applicable, and confidence scores are available to quickly filter high quality extracted data for downstream processing and lower manual review time.\n\n\nLearn more on custom field extraction preview.\n\nCreate engaging experiences with prebuilt and custom avatars \nToday we are excited to announce that Text to Speech (TTS) Avatar, a capability of Azure AI Speech service, is now generally available. This service brings natural-sounding voices and photorealistic avatars to life, across diverse languages and voices, enhancing customer engagement and overall experience. With TTS Avatar, developers can create personalized and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, while also improving efficiency and providing innovative solutions.\nThe TTS Avatar service provides developers with a variety of pre-built avatars, featuring a diverse portfolio of natural-sounding voices, as well as an option to create custom synthetic voices using Azure Custom Neural Voice. Additionally, the photorealistic avatars can be customized to match a company’s branding. For example, Fujifilm is using TTS Avatar with NURA, the world’s first AI-powered health screening center. \n“Embracing the Azure TTS Avatar at NURA as our 24-hour AI assistant marks a pivotal step in healthcare innovation. At NURA, we envision a future where AI-powered assistants redefine customer interactions, brand management, and healthcare delivery. Working with Microsoft, we’re honored to pioneer the next generation of digital experiences, revolutionizing how businesses connect with customers and elevate brand experiences, paving the way for a new era of personalized care and engagement.
