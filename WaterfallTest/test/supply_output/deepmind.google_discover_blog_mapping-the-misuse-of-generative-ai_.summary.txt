"Google DeepMind is actively studying and mapping the misuse of generative AI technology. They aim to understand the risks involved and develop methods to detect and mitigate those risks. The company emphasizes responsible and ethical use of AI and is collaborating with other organizations to analyze the misuse of this technology. Their research has identified various tactics used by bad actors, and they propose initiatives and interventions to protect the public. Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet (Google's parent company), has released a research paper outlining common misuse tactics and strategies for generative AI. They aim to combat misuse and promote responsible use of AI."
