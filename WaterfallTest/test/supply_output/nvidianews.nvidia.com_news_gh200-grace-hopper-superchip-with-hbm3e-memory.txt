This high-speed, coherent technology gives the GPU full access to the CPU memory, providing a combined 1.2TB of fast memory when in dual configuration.\nHBM3e memory, which is 50% faster than current HBM3, delivers a total of 10TB/sec of combined bandwidth, allowing the new platform to run models 3.5x larger than the previous version, while improving performance with 3x faster memory bandwidth.\nGrowing Demand for Grace Hopper\r\nLeading manufacturers are already offering systems based on the previously announced Grace Hopper Superchip. To drive broad adoption of the technology, the next-generation Grace Hopper Superchip platform with HBM3e is fully compatible with the NVIDIA MGX™ server specification unveiled at COMPUTEX earlier this year. With MGX, any system manufacturer can quickly and cost-effectively add Grace Hopper into over 100 server variations.\nAvailability\r\nLeading system manufacturers are expected to deliver systems based on the platform in Q2 of calendar year 2024.\nWatch Huang’s SIGGRAPH keynote address on demand to learn more about Grace Hopper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
