decision-making and brainstorming process. Combining AI's suggestions with your expertise and knowledge of your business and market will yield the best results. By integrating these AI insights, we're not merely keeping up with the times; we're pioneering a future where efficiency meets innovation.\t\t\n\n\nIn the last few years, generative AI has seen exponential growth. Language models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 on Azure OpenAI Service can automate content generation and conversational experiences, making it easier and more efficient to communicate with customers and end users.\nAI input prompts defined\nA prompt, in the context of AI, particularly in large language models, refers to the input or instruction given by users to elicit a specific type of response. To get the most out of large language models like GPT-4, it’s imperative to craft prompts that yield effective results. The challenge lies in choosing the best combination of words, expressions, symbols, and structures to steer the model toward producing accurate and pertinent content.\nWhy prompts matter\nJust like when communicating in real life, how you ask for what you want can limit—or expand—the type of information you receive.\n\n\n\n\t\t\texplore\t\t\n\nAI transformation \n\n\n\nPrompts help specify the user’s intent and expectation from AI, hence more precise prompts lead to more accurate and relevant results. They allow users to obtain a wide variety of responses, from answering questions, creating stories in the tone of your favorite author, generating poetry, and even performing code-related tasks.\nSimilar prompts can lead to varying responses based on the underlying model, its training data, or even subtle variations in how you phrase your request.\nFollowing you’ll find prompt tips to help you create the kind of content you need, whether at work or play.\nGet started! Twenty-five prompt tips for your best content creation to date\n\nKnow what you wantClearly outline the problem or need you’re trying to address. For instance, “I need fresh ideas for a marketing campaign geared toward our latest app.”\nStart with a simple questionBegin with a simple question to check the model’s understanding, then build into more complex queries.\nAsk open-ended questionsGenerative models work best when they’re free to roam. Instead of asking, “Should I use social media for marketing?” ask, “What are some innovative ways to grab attention across my social media platforms.” You can even specify the specific platform you plan to use (X, LinkedIn, etc.).\nIterate and refineUse the feedback you get from initial prompts then build on it. Like an idea about a general content marketing strategy? Follow up with, “How can I implement a content marketing strategy for a tech product designed to monitor how happy my pet is while I’m away from home?”\nProvide contextThe more context you provide, the better AI can tailor its response to your unique situation. For example, “I just released an app to track sleep patterns and am looking for low-cost marketing strategies that appeal to businesses concerned with their employee’s well-being.”\nState your boundariesMention any constraints (e.g., budget, timeline, resources) upfront. “What are marketing strategies for a new product that can be executed within a 5,000 USD budget and within a two-week period?”\nGo big (then small)Break down big questions into smaller ones for more actionable insights. Instead of asking “How can I improve my business?” ask “How can I increase online sales?” Then, followed up with “What social media platforms are best for advertising beanbags?”\nOpposites attract: Marry creative and analytical requestsAIs can handle both creative brainstorming and analytical tasks. But divide and conquer for the best results. Brainstorm marketing strategies, then follow up with “What are the pros and cons of influencer marketing?”\nStrengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT)A SWOT analysis can help get your business on the right path. Ask AI to perform a SWOT analysis using specifics about your business for immediately actionable items you can get started on ASAP.\nAsk for examplesGrasping a concept is easier with an example on hand. Ask for an example then use it as a potential model. You’ll discover what does—and doesn’t—work for your specific case. For example, “Can you provide a case study of a successful influencer marketing campaign?”\nSpecify the formatWant answers in bullet points, a paragraph, or a list? Make mention of that and see your wishes take literal form.\nDefine tech termsIf there’s a term or acronym specific to your industry, use a prompt to define it, or ensure the model understands the context in which it’s being used.\nRephrase for precisionIf the initial answer isn’t satisfactory, rephrase your question. Not only will you get your creative communicative juices, but you’ll also find that answers to your questions can prompt new directions in your thinking.\nIn-depth versus short-formWant a summary in a single paragraph or a pages-long academic deep dive? Make mention of your preferences in your prompt.\nUse negative instructions for a positive effectIf you know what you don’t want, specify that. E.g., “Provide marketing strategies excluding online advertisements.”\nMultiple answersAsk for multiple answers or perspectives to a single question for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of your topic.\nRequest sourcesWhile most models don’t browse the web in real-time, asking it to base its answer on known sources up to its last training data can provide greater credibility.\nLimit biasExplicitly ask the model to give an unbiased answer or to consider multiple perspectives.\nContext is keyAsk for compliance requirements for specific industries. “What are the current trends in generative AI?” “What compliance requirements should I keep in mind for healthcare related topics?\nPower in numbersQuantify whenever possible: Need numbers or percentages? Metrics, distances, or speed? Include this request in your prompt.\nAvoid leading questionsEnsure your question doesn’t steer the model towards a specific answer—unless that’s your intention.\nTone it down (or up)If you need fun, out-of-the-box content versus a more academic tone, mention that. E.g., “Provide a fun creative tagline for a green energy campaign.”\nProvide real-world implicationsExplain why you need the answer or how it’ll be used for more context. We’re launching a new cookie testing app next month. How should we position it against competitor x?”\nSafety and accuracyCross-reference critical information provided by the model with trusted external sources, especially if decisions based on the model’s answer have significant business implications.\nRefine over timeIf you’re using the model regularly, note down what types of prompts give you the best results and refine them accordingly.\n\nThink of generative AI prompts as a multifunctional tool built for the digital age, adept at both enhancing business strategies and enriching our home lives.
