The large language models can be customized with lore and character backstories, and protected against counterproductive or unsafe conversations via NeMo Guardrails.\nNVIDIA Riva — for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech to enable live speech conversation.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face™ — for instantly creating expressive facial animation of a game character to match any speech track. Audio2Face features Omniverse connectors for Unreal Engine 5, so developers can add facial animation directly to MetaHuman characters.\n\nDevelopers can integrate the entire NVIDIA ACE for Games solution or use only the components they need.\n‘Kairos’ Offers a Peek at the Future of Games\nNVIDIA collaborated with Convai, an NVIDIA Inception startup, to showcase how developers will soon be able to use NVIDIA ACE for Games to build NPCs. Convai, which is focused on developing cutting-edge conversational AI for virtual game worlds, integrated ACE modules into its end-to-end real-time avatar platform.\nIn a demo, called Kairos, players interact with Jin, the purveyor of a ramen shop. Although he is an NPC, Jin replies to natural language queries realistically and consistent with the narrative backstory — all with the help of generative AI. Watch the demo, which is rendered in Unreal Engine 5 using the latest ray-tracing features and NVIDIA DLSS.\n“With NVIDIA ACE for Games, Convai’s tools can achieve the latency and quality needed to make AI non-playable characters available to nearly every developer in a cost-efficient way,” said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai.\nDeploy NVIDIA ACE for Gaming Models Locally or in the Cloud\nThe neural networks enabling NVIDIA ACE for Games are optimized for different capabilities, with various size, performance and quality trade-offs. The ACE for Games foundry service will help developers fine-tune models for their games, then deploy via NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, GeForce RTX™ PCs or on premises for real-time inferencing.\nThe models are optimized for latency — a critical requirement for immersive, responsive interactions in games.\nGenerative AI to Transform the Gaming Experience\nGame developers and startups are already using NVIDIA generative AI technologies for their workflows.\n\nGSC Game World, one of Europe’s leading game developers, is adopting Audio2Face in its upcoming game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl.\nFallen Leaf, an indie game developer, is using Audio2Face for character facial animation in Fort Solis, a third-person sci-fi thriller that takes place on Mars.\nCharisma.ai, a company enabling virtual characters through AI, is leveraging Audio2Face to power the animation in its conversation engine.\n\nLearn more about building on NVIDIA Omniverse using NVIDIA ACE and other technology advancements at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the industrial metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
