Additionally, several NVIDIA partners have announced Spectrum-based products, including ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE, Ingrasys, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Wistron and Wiwynn, which join Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro in incorporating the platform into their offerings.\n“Rapid advancements in groundbreaking technologies like generative AI underscore the necessity for every business to prioritize networking innovation to gain a competitive edge,” said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionizes Ethernet networking to let businesses fully harness the power of their AI infrastructures to transform their operations and their industries.”\nAnnual Release Cadence\r\nSpectrum-X is the world’s first Ethernet fabric built for AI, accelerating generative AI network performance by 1.6x over traditional Ethernet fabrics.\nTo meet the industry’s strong demand for the performance Spectrum provides, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today announced during his COMPUTEX keynote in Taiwan that NVIDIA plans to launch new Spectrum-X products every year, delivering increased bandwidth and ports and enhanced software feature sets and programmability to drive leading AI Ethernet networking performance.\nFeaturing the NVIDIA Spectrum SN5600 Ethernet switch and the NVIDIA BlueField® -3 SuperNIC, Spectrum-X is an end-to-end platform built with the performance and features required by generative AI clouds. Leveraging adaptive routing and congestion control for maximum bandwidth and noise isolation, it offers the highest-performance Ethernet networking for AI, providing predictable outcomes for thousands of simultaneous AI jobs at every scale.\nCombined with NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs, the platform enables advanced cloud multi-tenancy, GPU compute elasticity and zero-trust security. With it, cloud service providers can accelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions while improving their return on investment.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Spectrum-X during Huang’s keynote address at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Spectrum-X, NVIDIA Spectrum SN5600 Ethernet switch, NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNIC, and NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs; third parties using and adopting our technologies and products, our collaboration and partnership with third parties and the benefits and impact thereof, and the features and performance of their offerings; rapid advancements in groundbreaking technologies like generative AI underscoring the necessity for every business to prioritize networking innovation to gain a competitive edge; and NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionizing Ethernet networking to let businesses fully harness the power of their AI infrastructures to transform their operations and their industries are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.
