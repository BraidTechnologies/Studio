"Code Llama is a language model designed to generate code and understand natural language related to coding. It has different versions specialized in Python and natural language instructions. It outperforms other models in tests and is useful for developers and learners, supporting popular programming languages. Code Llama has different sizes available, can handle large inputs, and has been fine-tuned for specific cases. It is recommended for coding tasks but not for general natural language. Safety measures were taken, and guidelines are provided to ensure responsible use. Code Llama is an open model available on GitHub, with additional resources like a research paper and newsletter."
