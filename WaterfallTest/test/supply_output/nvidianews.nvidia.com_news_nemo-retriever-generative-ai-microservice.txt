Developers using the microservice can connect their AI applications to business data wherever it resides across clouds and data centers. It adds NVIDIA-optimized RAG capabilities to AI foundries and is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, available in AWS Marketplace.\nCadence, Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are among the pioneers working with NVIDIA to build production-ready RAG capabilities into their custom generative AI applications and services.\n“Generative AI applications with RAG capabilities are the next killer app of the enterprise,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, developers can create customized generative AI chatbots, copilots and summarization tools that can access their business data to transform productivity with accurate and valuable generative AI intelligence.”\nGlobal Leaders Enhance LLM Accuracy With NeMo Retriever\r\nElectronic systems design leader Cadence serves companies across hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, mobile, aerospace, consumer and healthcare markets. It is working with NVIDIA to develop RAG features for generative AI applications in industrial electronics design.\n“Generative AI introduces innovative approaches to address customer needs, such as tools to uncover potential flaws early in the design process,” said Anirudh Devgan, president and CEO of Cadence. “Our researchers are working with NVIDIA to use NeMo Retriever to further boost the accuracy and relevance of generative AI applications to reveal issues and help customers get high-quality products to market faster.”\nCracking the Code for Accurate Generative AI Applications\r\nUnlike open-source RAG toolkits, NeMo Retriever supports production-ready generative AI with commercially viable models, API stability, security patches and enterprise support.\nNVIDIA-optimized algorithms power the highest accuracy results in Retriever’s embedding models. The optimized embedding models capture relationships between words, enabling LLMs to process and analyze textual data.\nUsing NeMo Retriever, enterprises can connect their LLMs to multiple data sources and knowledge bases, so that users can easily interact with data and receive accurate, up-to-date answers using simple, conversational prompts. Businesses using Retriever-powered applications can allow users to securely gain access to information spanning numerous data modalities, such as text, PDFs, images and videos.\nEnterprises can use NeMo Retriever to achieve more accurate results with less training, speeding time to market and supporting energy efficiency in the development of generative AI applications.\nReliable, Simple, Secure Deployment With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\r\nCompanies can deploy NeMo Retriever-powered applications to run during inference on NVIDIA-accelerated computing on virtually any data center or cloud. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports accelerated, high-performance inference with NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™, NVIDIA TensorRT™, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and other NVIDIA AI software.\nTo maximize inference performance, developers can run their models on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with TensorRT-LLM software.\nAvailability\r\nDevelopers can sign up for early access to NVIDIA NeMo Retriever.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
