"Google.org has released a report highlighting the use of generative AI in nonprofits. The report reveals that 75% of nonprofits believe AI can impact their marketing efforts, but many face barriers due to unfamiliarity with the technology. Google for Nonprofits offers training resources and has donated over $2 billion in grants and access to AI-powered tools. The report also provides ways for nonprofits to use generative AI tools in areas like grant proposals and donor databases."
