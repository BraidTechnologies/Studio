"DALL路E 2 is an AI system that can generate realistic images and art from text descriptions. It has higher resolution than its predecessor, DALL路E 1. There are safety measures in place to limit the generation of violent, hate, and adult content, as well as preventing the creation of photorealistic images of real people. The deployment of DALL路E 2 is phased and aims to support creative expression and understand AI perception.
