"YouTube is launching a new tool for creators to disclose when their content is altered or synthetic, using generative AI. The aim is to promote transparency and trust between creators and viewers. The disclosure will appear as labels on the video player or in the expanded description. YouTube will begin labeling such videos on the app and eventually on all platforms. It is also working on a privacy process to request the removal of AI-generated content that simulates real people."
