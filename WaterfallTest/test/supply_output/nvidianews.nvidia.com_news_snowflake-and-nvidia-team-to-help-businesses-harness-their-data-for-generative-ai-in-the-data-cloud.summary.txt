"Snowflake and NVIDIA are teaming up to allow businesses to create custom generative AI applications using their own data. Snowflake will use NVIDIA's NeMo platform and GPU-accelerated computing to enable enterprises to develop large language models for AI services while keeping data secure. They aim to provide industry-specific solutions in healthcare, retail, financial services, and more. Snowflake plans to host and run NVIDIA's NeMo platform to enhance the ability to leverage proprietary data and reduce cost and latency while maintaining data security. The collaboration includes product integrations and a fireside chat at Snowflake Summit 2023. Both companies have their own trademarks and product names, and the press release includes forward-looking statements."
