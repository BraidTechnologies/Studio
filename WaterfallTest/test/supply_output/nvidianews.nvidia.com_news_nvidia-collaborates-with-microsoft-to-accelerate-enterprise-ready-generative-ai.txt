NVIDIA AI Enterprise complements Azure Machine Learning with secure, production-ready AI capabilities and includes access to NVIDIA experts and support.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise includes over 100 frameworks, pretrained models and development tools, such as NVIDIA RAPIDS™ for accelerating data science workloads. NVIDIA Metropolis accelerates vision AI model development, and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™ supports enterprises in standardizing model deployment and execution.\nAvailability \r\nThe NVIDIA AI Enterprise integration with Azure Machine Learning is available in a limited technical preview.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is also available on Azure Marketplace, providing businesses worldwide with expanded options for fully secure and supported AI development and deployment.\nAdditionally, the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud™ platform-as-a-service is now available on Microsoft Azure as a private offer for enterprises. Omniverse Cloud provides developers and enterprises with a full-stack cloud environment to design, develop, deploy and manage industrial metaverse applications at scale.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the industrial metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
