With NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, developers can test sensor perception and associated AI software at scale in physically accurate, realistic virtual environments before real-world deployment — enhancing safety while saving time and costs.\n“Developing safe and reliable autonomous machines powered by generative physical AI requires training and testing in physically based virtual worlds,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will enable developers to easily build large-scale digital twins of factories, cities and even Earth — helping accelerate the next wave of AI.”\nSupercharging Simulation at Scale\r\nBuilt on the OpenUSD framework and powered by NVIDIA RTX™ ray-tracing and neural-rendering technologies, Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX accelerates the creation of simulated environments by combining real-world data from videos, cameras, radar and lidar with synthetic data.\nEven for scenarios with limited real-world data, the microservices can be used to simulate a broad range of activities, such as whether a robotic arm is operating correctly, an airport luggage carousel is functional, a tree branch is blocking a roadway, a factory conveyor belt is in motion, or a robot or person is nearby.\nResearch Wins Drive Real-World Deployment\r\nThe Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX announcement comes at the same time as NVIDIA’s first-place win at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference’s Autonomous Grand Challenge for End-to-End Driving at Scale.\nNVIDIA researchers’ winning workflow can be replicated in high-fidelity simulated environments with Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX — giving autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation developers the ability to test self-driving scenarios in physically accurate environments before deploying AVs in the real world.\nEcosystem Access and Availability \nForetellix and MathWorks are among the first software developers to which NVIDIA is providing Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX access for AV development.\nOmniverse Cloud Sensor RTX will also enable sensor manufacturers to validate and integrate digital twins of their sensors in virtual environments, reducing the time needed for physical prototyping.\nSign up for early access to Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, which will be available later this year.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to :the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA’s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX and NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and neural rendering technologies; third parties using or adopting our products or technologies; NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices enabling developers to easily develop large-scale digital twins for factories, cities and even the Earth — helping accelerate the next wave of AI are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.
