"NVIDIA, in collaboration with global partners like Accenture, Cisco, Dell Technologies, and others, has launched the NIM Agent Blueprints, designed to enable enterprises to create and deploy their own AI applications. These blueprints offer customizable workflows and come with pre-trained AI models that serve various use cases like customer service, drug discovery, and data extraction from PDFs. These AI applications can be integrated with NVIDIA's AI Enterprise Platform, which includes NIM microservices and the NeMo framework. The initiative aims to accelerate the adoption and operationalization of generative AI in enterprises by providing ready-to-use, open-source models and comprehensive deployment guides."
