"Tech company Meta has released a large language model called LLaMA, consisting of 65 billion parameters, to aid AI researchers. This model helps test new approaches and explore new use cases in the field. While accessibility and computing power requirements are reduced with smaller models like LLaMA, biases and other issues still need to be addressed. The model is versatile and can be shared with other researchers to tackle problems such as bias, toxic comments, and hallucinations. It will be accessible to academic researchers, government organizations, civil society, and industry research laboratories. Responsible guidelines for large language models must be developed collaboratively by the AI community.
