AI Studio is intended for professional software developers including cloud architects and technical decision-makers who want to create generative AI applications and custom copilot experiences.              02/       Can I use models other than ChatGPT in Azure OpenAI service?           Yes. Azure AI Studio includes a robust and growing catalog of frontier and open-source models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta, and other partners that can be applied over your data. You can even compare models by task using open-source datasets and evaluate the model with your own test data to see how the pretrained model would perform to fit your own use case.              03/       Is prompt flow the Microsoft equivalent of LangChain?           Prompt flow is complementary to LangChain and Semantic Kernel—and it can work with either. Prompt flow provides evaluation, deployment, well-defined asset monitoring, and flow logic to help debug applications and test orchestration at scale.              04/       How is prompt injection handled, and how do I ensure no malicious code is running from prompt injection?           Prompt templates in prompt flow provide robust examples and instructions for avoiding prompt injection attacks in the application. Azure AI Content Safety helps to detect offensive or inappropriate content in text and images. Content moderation also checks for jail breaks.              05/       Is there fine-tuning in Azure AI Studio?           Azure AI Studio offers retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompt crafting in addition to fine-tuning, which can help improve the accuracy of open-source models.
