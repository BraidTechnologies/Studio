"NVIDIA has released a major upgrade to its Omniverse platform, adding generative AI and OpenUSD features. The upgrade enables developers and industrial enterprises to optimize their 3D pipelines and improve workflows. The platform now supports extended reality tools, spatial integration, and partnerships with Adobe and Wonder Dynamics. NVIDIA's Move One app allows single-camera motion capture, and Omniverse supports OpenXR and SideFX Houdini assets. Many customers, including Boston Dynamics and Volvo Cars, are already using Omniverse for simulation and training. NVIDIA is also providing RTX workstations for designers and engineers."
