That same self-expression and customization is core to the Android experience, spanning billions of active devices around the world.Today at I/O 2023, we’re introducing new ways to personalize your Android phone, powered by Google’s advances in generative AI technology. See how Android can help you transform the look and feel of your device across your messages, lock screen, wallpaper and more.\n\n\n\n\nLevel up your conversations with MessagesMagic Compose, a new Messages by Google feature powered by generative AI, can help you add an extra spark of personality to your conversations. It'll offer suggested responses based on the context of your messages, and even magically transform what you write into different styles. Make your messages more concise, professional or even written like Shakespeare himself! Experiment for yourself and try Magic Compose when it rolls out this summer in beta.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Video format not supported\n          \n\n\n\n\nLevel up your entire phone screenTwo years ago we introduced Material You, giving people a cohesive palette of colors derived from their wallpaper choice, that personalizes the look of their entire Android experience. With the arrival of Android 14 later this year, we’re taking customization to the next level. You’ll be able to bring your own inspiration to customize your lock screen with new shortcuts and beautifully crafted clocks. Plus, try a new monochrome color theme that can be applied across your entire phone experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Video format not supported\n                \nThree phones each showing a different UI screen.

Watch them come to life when you unlock or tilt your device.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Video format not supported\n          \n\n\n\n\nBut not everyone has the perfect photo ready to use for their wallpaper — or they just prefer to create something new and fun. With Generative AI wallpaper, you can answer suggested prompts to describe your ultimate creative vision. Using Google’s text-to-image diffusion model, your phone will generate unique wallpapers for you to choose from. Thanks to Material You, the color palette of your Android system will automatically match the wallpaper you’ve selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Video format not supported\n          \n\n\n\n\nLevel up your social postsSharing your experiences with others on social media can be a great way to connect with your community. Ensuring those apps can take full advantage of Android devices is important to us.We’re bringing new support for Night Mode and 10-bit HDR video in social apps like Instagram. Plus we’re introducing Ultra HDR in Android 14 so you can take and view photos with bright colors, crisp shadows and all-around amazing definition.Together, these features will help you make your device feel even more like your own, with new customizations and AI capabilities powered by Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Get more stories from Google in your inbox.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n    Email address\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n              Your information will be used in accordance with\n            \nGoogle's privacy policy.\n\n\n            Subscribe\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone.
