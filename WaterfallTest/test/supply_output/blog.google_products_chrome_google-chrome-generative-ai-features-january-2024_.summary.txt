"Google Chrome is introducing three new generative AI features to improve browsing efficiency and personalization. These features include an automatic tab organizer, custom theme creation using AI, and AI-powered writing help. Initially available for Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs in the U.S., these features are experimental and not available for enterprise and educational accounts. Google Chrome also allows users to customize their browser with uploaded photos or themes from the Chrome Web Store. More AI and ML integrations are planned for Chrome in the future."
