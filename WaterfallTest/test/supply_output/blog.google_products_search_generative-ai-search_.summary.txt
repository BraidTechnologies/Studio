"Google is using generative AI to improve its search engine, providing more relevant information for users. The AI will offer snapshots of key information, suggest next steps, and allow follow-up questions. Google is also introducing an AI shopping experience in search results, with detailed product descriptions and reviews. These features aim to make searching and decision-making easier. The new AI capabilities will be available through the SGE experiment in Search Labs."
