Accessed through a simplified interface running on a local system, it allows developers to customize models from popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and NVIDIA NGC™ using custom data. The models can then be shared easily across multiple platforms.\n“Enterprises around the world are racing to find the right infrastructure and build generative AI models and applications,” said Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI Workbench provides a simplified path for cross-organizational teams to create the AI-based applications that are increasingly becoming essential in modern business.”\nA New Era for AI Developers\r\nWhile hundreds of thousands of pretrained models are now available, customizing them with the many open-source tools can require hunting through multiple online repositories for the right framework, tools and containers, and employing the right skills to customize a model for a specific use case.\nWith NVIDIA AI Workbench, developers can customize and run generative AI in just a few clicks. It allows them to pull together all necessary enterprise-grade models, frameworks, software development kits and libraries from open-source repositories and the NVIDIA AI platform into a unified developer toolkit.\n\r\nLeading AI infrastructure providers — including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lambda, Lenovo and Supermicro — are embracing AI Workbench for its ability to augment their latest generation of multi-GPU-capable desktop workstations, high-end mobile workstations and virtual workstations.\nDevelopers with a Windows or Linux-based NVIDIA RTX™ PC or workstation will also be able to initiate, test and fine-tune enterprise-grade generative AI projects on their local RTX systems, and easily access data center and cloud computing resources to scale as needed.\nNew NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 Software Advances AI Deployment \r\nTo further accelerate the adoption of generative AI, NVIDIA announced the latest version of its enterprise software platform, NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0. It gives businesses the tools needed to adopt generative AI, while also offering the security and API stability required for reliable production deployments.\nNewly supported software and tools in NVIDIA AI Enterprise that help streamline generative AI deployment include:\n\nNVIDIA NeMo™, a cloud-native framework to build, customize and deploy large language models. With NeMo, NVIDIA AI Enterprise provides end-to-end support for creating and customizing LLM applications.\nNVIDIA Triton™ Management Service, which helps automate and optimize production deployments. It allows enterprises to automatically deploy multiple NVIDIA Triton Inference Server instances in Kubernetes with model orchestration for efficient operation of scalable AI.\nNVIDIA Base Command Manager Essentials cluster management software, which helps enterprises maximize performance and utilization of AI servers across data center, multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments.\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise software — which lets users build and run NVIDIA AI-enabled solutions across the cloud, data center and edge — is certified to run on mainstream NVIDIA-Certified Systems™, NVIDIA DGX systems, all major cloud platforms and newly announced NVIDIA RTX workstations.\nLeading software companies ServiceNow and Snowflake, as well as infrastructure provider Dell Technologies, which offers Dell Generative AI Solutions, recently announced they are collaborating with NVIDIA to enable new generative AI solutions and services on their platforms. The integration of NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 and NVIDIA NeMo provides a foundation for production-ready generative AI for customers.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0 will be integrated into partner marketplaces, including AWS Marketplace, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as through NVIDIA cloud partner Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nAdditionally, MLOps providers, including Azure Machine Learning, ClearML, Domino Data Lab, Run:AI, and Weights & Biases, are adding seamless integration with the NVIDIA AI platform to simplify production-grade generative AI model development.\nBroad Partner Support\r\n“Dell Technologies and NVIDIA are committed to helping enterprises build purpose-built AI models to access the immense opportunity of generative AI. With NVIDIA AI Workbench, developers can take advantage of the full Dell Generative AI Solutions portfolio to customize models on PCs, workstations and data center infrastructure.” — Meghana Patwardhan, vice president of commercial client products at Dell Technologies\n“Most enterprises do not have the expertise, budget and data center resources to manage the high complexity of AI software and systems. We look forward to NVIDIA AI Workbench’s potential to simplify generative AI project creation with one-click training and deployment on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.” — Evan Sparks, chief product officer for AI at HPE\n“As a workstation market leader offering the performance and efficiency needed for the most demanding data science and AI models, we have a long history collaborating with NVIDIA. HP is embracing the next generation of high-performance systems, coupled with NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs and NVIDIA AI Workbench, and bringing the power of generative AI to our enterprise customers and helping move AI workloads between the cloud and locally.” — Jim Nottingham, senior vice president of advanced computing solutions at HP Inc.\n“Lenovo and NVIDIA are helping customers overcome deployment complexities and more easily implement generative AI to deliver transformative services and products to the market. NVIDIA AI Workbench and the Lenovo AI-ready portfolio enable developers to leverage the power of their smart devices and scale across edge-to-cloud infrastructure.” — Rob Herman, vice president and general manager of Lenovo Workstation & Client AI \n“The longstanding VMware and NVIDIA partnership has helped unlock the power of AI for every business by delivering an end-to-end enterprise platform optimized for AI workloads. Together, we are making generative AI more accessible and easier to implement in the enterprise. With AI Workbench, NVIDIA is giving developers a set of powerful tools to help enterprises accelerate gen AI adoption. With the new NVIDIA AI Workbench, development teams can seamlessly move AI workloads from the desktop to production.” — Chris Wolf, vice president of VMware AI Labs\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s SIGGRAPH keynote address on demand to learn more about NVIDIA AI Workbench and NVIDIA AI Enterprise 4.0.\nAI Workbench is coming soon in early access.
