And now, as we approach the busiest shopping weeks of the year, technology — especially generative AI — is making it much easier to find gifts for others (and ourselves).Read on for more about our new shopping experiences and opt into Search Labs at goo.gle/sge-gifts.Get AI-generated gift ideasSearch Generative Experience (SGE), which brings generative AI capabilities into Search, is designed to help you understand topics in faster, easier ways and uncover new insights — which can be especially useful for gift-giving. And today we’re rolling out a new capability within SGE to help holiday shoppers more easily get inspired and find that perfect holiday gift.Let’s say you’re looking for a present for the budding chef in your life and don’t know where to start. Search “great gifts for home cooks\", and you’ll now see a wide variety of subcategories to explore — like specialty tools, artisanal ingredients, culinary subscriptions and even experiences like cooking classes — with options from brands large and small. Just tap into a category to browse shoppable gift options and select a product to buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Video format not supported\n          \n\n\n\n\nWith generative AI, you can really home in on your gift recipient’s unique preferences. If you’re looking for “great gifts for home cooks who love pasta\", for instance, you can get more specific options that are sure to bring a smile to their face (and stomach). Or say your loved one has a more niche interest, like a 7 year old who wants to be an inventor. With this experience, you can get creative, specific, shoppable ideas — from chemistry sets to coding kits — and become a world-class gift-giver in no time.SGE is designed as a jumping-off point to explore the web. You’ll see links to helpful content from publishers front and center, so you can easily click through to a website to learn more about a product or gift category. In fact, with SGE we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. And as we’ve shared, Search and Shopping ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.If you're already opted into SGE in the U.S., you can start using this tool in the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop today. If not, you can opt in through Search Labs at goo.gle/sge-gifts.Shop what’s (literally) on your mind‘Tis the season for giving, but about half of people actually shop for themselves over the holidays.1 Shoppers, especially apparel shoppers, also often have a very specific vision in mind: In fact, 20% of apparel queries are five words or longer.2 So we’re introducing a new way to put the item that’s on your mind right into your shopping cart with AI-powered image generation for shopping.We’re connecting our image generation technology with more than 35 billion listings in our Shopping Graph to help you better visualize and find the style you’re looking for. Soon when you use SGE to look for apparel, you’ll have the option to generate photorealistic images inspired by the words you search — and shop products that match those images.Let’s say you want a new winter coat — a colorful, patterned puffer jacket — but you haven’t found quite what you’re looking for. With generative AI in Search, just look for that style and tap “Generate images” to see photorealistic images that match your vision. And if you want to make an adjustment, like if you’d prefer a colorful metallic jacket instead of a patterned one, just enter that refinement in the text box to see a new set of images. Once you’ve found one you like, scroll down to see similar shoppable products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re rolling out this new capability on mobile in the U.S. starting in December. At that time, anyone already opted into SGE can use this tool. If you’re not opted in, head to Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS).\n\n\n\n\nVirtually try on clothes, now including men’s topsGenerative AI can also help you get a better idea of what a piece of clothing will look like on you. Since launching our generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool for women’s tops, we’ve found that products with the option to virtually try on have received significantly higher-quality interactions from shoppers. That means shoppers are spending time using the feature and potentially taking action, like making a purchase. And today we’re expanding it to a new category: men’s tops.Now, when you search for “men’s tops” in the Google app or from any mobile browser (and soon, desktop) in the U.S., you’ll see results from hundreds of brands — like Abercrombie, Banana Republic, J.Crew and Under Armour — with a “try-on” icon. Just tap the result to see how that piece of clothing looks on a real model who resonates with you. You can select from 40 models ranging in skin tone, body shape, height and size so you can make a more confident decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you’re looking for just the right thing for family, friends or yourself this holiday season, these new generative AI tools can help you shop smarter and more confidently than ever.\n\n\n\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nGoogle/Ipsos, Holiday Shopping Study, Online survey, AR, AU, BR, CA, FR, DE, IT, MX, NL, ES, SE, UK, US, CL, CO, PE, BE, NO, FI, DK 18+, n=123,450, Oct 28, 2021 - Jan 5, 2022)\n\n\n\n2\n\nGoogle Internal Data, US, Apparel Query Length, 2023\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Related stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nNew ways to connect to the web with AI Overviews\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Hema Budaraju\n                    \n\n Aug 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping\n4 ways to shop for back to school on Google\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Lilian Rincon\n                    \n\n Aug 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n3 Trending Now updates to help you keep up with the latest trends\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Yonit Halperin Worzel\n                    \n\n Aug 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurs\n15 startups using AI to tackle big issues in infrastructure\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Karen Dahut\n                    \n\n Aug 08, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nHow we're addressing explicit fake content in Search\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Emma Higham\n                    \n\n Jul 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nNew ways to access About this image\n\n\n\n                  By\n                  \n                    \n                    Nidhi Hebbar\n                    \n\n Jul 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s stay in touch.
