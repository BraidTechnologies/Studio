(NASDAQ:DBX) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a collaboration to supercharge knowledge work and improve productivity for millions of Dropbox customers through the power of AI.\nThe companies’ collaboration will expand Dropbox’s extensive AI functionality with new uses for personalized generative AI to improve search accuracy, provide better organization, and simplify workflows for its customers across their cloud content.\nDropbox plans to leverage NVIDIA’s AI foundry consisting of NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and NVIDIA accelerated computing to enhance its latest AI-powered product experiences. These include Dropbox Dash, universal search that connects apps, tools, and content in a single search bar to help customers find what they need; Dropbox AI, a tool that allows customers to ask questions and get summaries on large files across their entire Dropbox; among other AI capabilities in Dropbox.\n“Recent advancements in generative AI are opening up a world of possibilities to improve knowledge work and address many of the pain points we all experience around organization, prioritization, and focus,” said Drew Houston, co-founder and CEO of Dropbox. “AI has the potential to offload routine tasks, unlock our creativity, and help us do more meaningful work. We’re excited to partner with NVIDIA and leverage their technology in new ways to deliver more personalized, AI-powered experiences to our customers.”\n“The arc of AI is expanding from cloud services into enterprise generative AI assistants that will drive the most significant transition in the computing industry to date,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together, NVIDIA and Dropbox will pave the way for millions of Dropbox customers to accelerate their work with customized generative AI applications.”\nAI to Transform Knowledge Work\r\nDropbox has long believed in the potential for AI to transform knowledge work. The company has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its core product experience for many years to help its customers do their most important work, save time, and be more efficient.\nNVIDIA has built flexible tools that will allow Dropbox to deliver new AI-powered capabilities and bring more intelligence to its customers’ content and workflows. Using NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and the NVIDIA NeMo™ framework — an end-to-end platform for building, customizing, and deploying large language models — Dropbox can customize and fine-tune LLMs to provide more personalized and relevant information with all the security controls, privacy, and transparency millions of Dropbox customers have come to rely on.\nDropbox can also increase inference performance for production AI with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™ and NVIDIA TensorRT™ -LLM.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping the industry.
