They include sample applications built with NVIDIA NeMo™, NVIDIA NIM and partner microservices, reference code, customization documentation and a Helm chart for deployment.\nEnterprises can modify NIM Agent Blueprints using their business data and run their generative AI applications across accelerated data centers and clouds. With NIM Agent Blueprints, enterprises can continually refine their AI applications based on user feedback, creating a data-driven AI flywheel.\nThe first NIM Agent Blueprints now available include a digital human workflow for customer service, a generative virtual screening workflow for computer-aided drug discovery and a multimodal PDF data extraction workflow for enterprise retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that can use vast quantities of business data for more accurate responses. NIM Agent Blueprints are free for developers to experience and download and can be deployed in production with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nGlobal system integrators and technology solutions providers Accenture, Deloitte, SoftServe and World Wide Technology (WWT) are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises worldwide. Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo are offering full-stack NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure and solutions to speed NIM Agent Blueprints deployments.\n“Generative AI is advancing at lightspeed. Frontier model capabilities are growing exponentially with a continuous stream of new applications,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The enterprise AI wave is here. With the NVIDIA AI Enterprise toolkit — including NeMo, NIM microservices and the latest NIM Agent Blueprints — our expansive partner ecosystem is poised to help enterprises customize open-source models, build bespoke AI applications and deploy them seamlessly across any cloud, on premises or at the edge.”\nDigital Human NIM Agent Blueprint Advances Customer Service\nGartner® reports that 80% of conversational offerings will embed generative AI by 2025, up from 20% in 2024(1). The digital human NIM Agent Blueprint for customer service helps enterprises rapidly prepare for this coming shift, bringing enterprise applications to life with a 3D animated avatar interface.\nWith approachable, humanlike interactions, customer service applications can provide more engaging user experiences compared to traditional customer service options. Powered by NVIDIA Tokkio technologies, the digital human workflow features NVIDIA software including NVIDIA ACE, NVIDIA Omniverse RTX™, NVIDIA Audio2Face™ and Llama 3.1 NIM microservices, and is designed to integrate with existing enterprise generative AI applications built using RAG.\nMultimodal PDF Data Extraction NIM Agent Blueprint Taps Business Data\nThe multimodal PDF data extraction workflow for enterprise RAG uses NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM microservices to unlock insights from massive volumes of enterprise PDF data. With this workflow, developers can create digital humans, AI agents or customer service chatbots that can quickly become experts on any topic captured within their corpus of PDF data.\nUsing the workflow, enterprises can combine NeMo Retriever NIM microservices with community or custom models to build high-accuracy, multimodal retrieval pipelines that can be deployed wherever enterprise data resides.\nGenerative Virtual Screening NIM Agent Blueprint Accelerates Drug Discovery\nThe generative virtual screening NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint for drug discovery accelerates the identification and optimization of promising drug-like molecules, significantly reducing time and cost by generating molecules with favorable properties and higher probabilities of success.\nResearchers and application developers can quickly customize and deploy AI models for 3D protein structure prediction, small molecule generation and molecular docking. This blueprint incorporates NVIDIA NIM microservices — including AlphaFold2, MolMIM and DiffDock — to accelerate the virtual screening of small molecules using generative models.\nIn combination with other tools available in NVIDIA BioNeMo™, enterprises can easily connect multiple NIM Agent Blueprints to build increasingly sophisticated AI applications and accelerate their drug discovery work.\nAdditional blueprints will be released monthly for workflows to build generative AI applications for customer experience, content generation, software engineering, and product research and development.\nNVIDIA Partner Ecosystem Amplifies Enterprise Generative AI Success\nNVIDIA partners are readying to help the world’s enterprises rapidly build and deploy their own generative AI applications using NIM Agent Blueprints.\nGlobal professional services company Accenture will add NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to its Accenture AI Refinery™, unveiled last month.\n“Across industries, generative AI is acting as a catalyst for companies looking to reinvent with tech, data and AI,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. “By integrating NVIDIA’s catalog of workflows into Accenture’s AI Refinery, we can help our clients develop custom AI systems at speed and reimagine how they do business and serve their customers to drive stronger business outcomes and create new
