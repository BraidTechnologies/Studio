Designed for mid-range training and inferencing, the NC series of virtual machines offers customers two classes of VMs from one to two NVIDIA H100 94GB PCIe Tensor Core GPUs and supports NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, which allows customers to partition each GPU into up to seven instances, providing flexibility and scalability for diverse AI workloads.\nHealthcare and Life Sciences Breakthroughs\r\nMicrosoft is expanding its collaboration with NVIDIA to transform healthcare and life sciences through the integration of cloud, AI and supercomputing technologies. By harnessing the power of Microsoft Azure alongside NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud and the NVIDIA Clara™ suite of microservices, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and medical device developers will soon be able to innovate rapidly across clinical research and care delivery with improved efficiency.\nIndustry leaders such as Sanofi and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, industry ISVs such as Flywheel and SOPHiA GENETICS, academic medical centers like the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, and health systems like Mass General Brigham are already leveraging cloud computing and AI to drive transformative changes in healthcare and to enhance patient care. \nIndustrial Digitalization\r\nNVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available first on Microsoft Azure later this year, enabling developers to bring increased data interoperability, collaboration, and physics-based visualization to existing software applications. At NVIDIA GTC, Microsoft is demonstrating a preview of what is possible using Omniverse Cloud APIs on Microsoft Azure. Using an interactive 3D viewer in Microsoft Power BI, factory operators can see real-time factory data overlaid on a 3D digital twin of their facility to gain new insights that can speed up production.\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server and Microsoft Copilot\r\nNVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™ help serve AI inference predictions in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. Copilot for Microsoft 365, soon available as a dedicated physical keyboard key on Windows 11 PCs, combines the power of large language models with proprietary enterprise data to deliver real-time contextualized intelligence, enabling users to enhance their creativity, productivity and skills. \nFrom AI Training to AI Deployment\r\nNVIDIA NIM™ inference microservices are coming to Azure AI to turbocharge AI deployments. Part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, also available on the Azure Marketplace, NIM provides cloud-native microservices for optimized inference on more than two dozen popular foundation models, including NVIDIA-built models that users can experience at ai.nvidia.com. For deployment, the microservices deliver pre-built, run-anywhere containers powered by NVIDIA AI Enterprise inference software — including Triton Inference Server, TensorRT™ and TensorRT-LLM — to help developers speed time to market of performance-optimized production AI applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
