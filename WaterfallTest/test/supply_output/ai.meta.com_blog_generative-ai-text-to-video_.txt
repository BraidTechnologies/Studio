Make-A-Video builds on Meta AI’s recent progress in generative technology research  and has the potential to open new opportunities for creators and artists. The system learns what the world looks like from paired text-image data and how the world moves from video footage with no associated text. As part of our continued commitment to open science, we’re sharing details in a research paper and plan to release a demo experience.  Generative AI research is pushing creative expression forward by giving people tools to quickly and easily create new content. With just a few words or lines of text, Make-A-Video can bring imagination to life and create one-of-a-kind videos full of vivid colors, characters, and landscapes. The system can also create videos from images or take existing videos and create new ones that are similar. Make-A-Video follows our announcement earlier this year of Make-A-Scene, a multimodal generative AI method that gives people more control over the AI generated content they create. With Make-A-Scene, we demonstrated how people can create photorealistic illustrations and storybook-quality art using words, lines of text, and freeform sketches. We want to be thoughtful about how we build new generative AI systems like this. Make-A-Video uses publicly available datasets, which adds an extra level of transparency to the research. We are openly sharing this generative AI research and results with the community for their feedback, and will continue to use our  responsible AI framework to refine and evolve our approach to this emerging technology.Learn more about Make-A-Video by visiting our site and reading the paper.
