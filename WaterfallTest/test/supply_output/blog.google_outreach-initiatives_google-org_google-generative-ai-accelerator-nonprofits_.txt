In fact, Google.org funding recipients report that AI helps them achieve their goals in one third of the time at nearly half the cost.But while a recent Google.org survey found that four in five nonprofits think generative AI may be applicable to their work, nearly half said their organization is not currently using the technology. They cite a lack of tools, awareness, training and funding as the biggest barriers to adoption.To help nonprofits make the most of this technology, we are announcing the Google.org Accelerator: Generative AI, a six-month program supporting nonprofits developing high-impact applications of generative AI. Our first cohort includes 21 organizations focused on areas like climate, economic opportunity, health, education and crisis response. In addition to technical training, workshops, mentors and pro bono support from a dedicated AI coach, Google.org is providing more than $20 million in funding across the projects.Through the Google.org Fellowship, teams of Googlers will also work with three of these nonprofits â€” Tarjimly, Benefits Data Trust and mRelief â€” full time for up to six months to help them build their proposed generative AI tools.Learn about some of the selected organizationsâ€™ projects below, and read more about other Google accelerator programs.Benefits Data Trust is using Large Language Models
