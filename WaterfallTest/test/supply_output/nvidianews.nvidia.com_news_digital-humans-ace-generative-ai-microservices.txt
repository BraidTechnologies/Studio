Now NVIDIA is building ACE PC NIM microservices for deployment across the installed base of 100 million RTX AI PCs and laptops.\nThese include NVIDIA Nemotron-3 4.5B, the company’s first SLM, which has been purpose-built to run on device with similar levels of precision and accuracy as large language models (LLMs) running in the cloud. Nemotron-3 4.5B SLM is now in early access. NVIDIA Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva ASR on-device models will be available soon in early access.\nThe new NVIDIA AI Inference Manager software development kit simplifies the deployment of ACE to PCs. It preconfigures the PC with the necessary AI models, engines and dependencies while orchestrating AI inference seamlessly across PCs and the cloud.\nAn updated version of the Covert Protocol tech demo, developed in collaboration with Inworld AI, is being shown at the COMPUTEX trade show. Using Audio2Face and Riva ASR running locally on GeForce RTX™ PCs, the demo allows players to interact and influence digital-human non-playable characters (NPCs) with conversational language to complete their mission.\nDigital Human Ecosystem Expands With Latest ACE Technologies\r\nACE is making waves with developers building a variety of applications from companies such as Aww Inc., Dell Technologies, Gumption, Hippocratic AI, Inventec, OurPalm, Perfect World Games, Reallusion, ServiceNow, Soulbotix, SoulShell and UneeQ.\nAww Inc., a pioneering virtual human company based in Japan, launched its first virtual celebrity, Imma, in 2018. Imma has since become the face of major global brands in more than 50 countries. Now, Aww Inc. plans to leverage ACE Audio2Face microservices for real-time animation, enabling a highly interactive communication experience with its users.\nPerfect World Games, a game developer and publisher, is adopting ACE in its new mythological wilderness tech demo, Legends. Players can interact with a fully interactive, realistic, multilingual, AI NPC in both English and Mandarin. Using NVIDIA Audio2Face NIM, the character’s audio responses generate realistic facial animation in real time.\nInventec, a major technology company that is investing heavily in AI, is using NVIDIA Audio2Face NIM to enhance its healthcare AI agent within the VRSTATE platform. The integration provides a more engaging, comforting virtual consultation experience. At COMPUTEX, Inventec is showcasing an AI agent that can help patients access information about their health.\nServiceNow, the AI platform for business transformation, recently showcased ACE NIM in a generative AI service agent demo for its Now Assist Gen AI Experience, highlighting the potential for digital avatars to enhance customer and employee interactions across industries including retail, travel and more.\nDell Technologies unveiled its cutting-edge Dell Generative AI Solution for Digital Assistants at Dell Technologies World last month. The offering allows businesses to leverage intelligent digital assistants that engage customers through natural conversations across various industries such as retail, healthcare and customer service.\nNVIDIA Celebrates Digital Human Startups at COMPUTEX 2024\r\nNVIDIA art teams used generative AI tools built on ACE, including Synthesia and Hour One, to produce a “digital Jensen” avatar that was generated by video from text.\nThe multilingual avatar featured Huang’s unique voice and style, generated by ElevenLabs’ proprietary AI speech and voice technology in Mandarin Chinese and English. NVIDIA also collaborated with Voicemod, an NVIDIA Inception member specializing in AI voice technology, to compose the ending theme song of Huang’s keynote.\nACE NIM Now Available\r\nNVIDIA ACE NIM microservices for server deployments including Riva and Audio2Face are now in production, adding NVIDIA AI Enterprise software for developers to receive enterprise-class support. Register for early access to ACE NIM microservices that run on RTX AI PCs.\nWatch Huang’s COMPUTEX keynote to see the latest in ACE content.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features, and availability of NVIDIA’s products and technologies, including NVIDIA ACE generative AI microservices, NVIDIA Riva ASR, TTS and NMT, NVIDIA Nemotron LLM and SLM, NVIDIA Audio2Face, NVIDIA Audio2Gesture, NVIDIA Omniverse RTX, NVIDIA Nemotron-3 4.5B, NVIDIA AI Inference Manager, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA’s collaborations with third parties, and the features and availability of their services and offerings; third parties’ use or adoption of NVIDIA products, technologies and platforms, and the benefits and impacts thereof; digital humans revolutionizing industries; and breakthroughs in multi-modal large language models and neural graphics — delivered by NVIDIA ACE to our ecosystem of developers — bringing us closer to a future of intent-driven computing, where interacting with computers is as natural as interacting with humans are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.
