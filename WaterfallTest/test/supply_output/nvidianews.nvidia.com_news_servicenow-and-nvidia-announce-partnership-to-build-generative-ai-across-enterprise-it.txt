Customer service teams can use generative AI for automatic issue resolution, knowledge-base article generation based on customer case summaries, and chat summarization for faster hand-off, resolution and wrap-up. \nIn addition, generative AI can improve the employee experience by helping identify growth opportunities. For example, delivering customized learning and development recommendations, like courses and mentors, based on natural language queries and information from an employee’s profile. \nFull-Stack NVIDIA Generative AI Software and Infrastructure Fuel Rapid Development\r\nIn its generative AI research and development, ServiceNow is using NVIDIA AI Foundations cloud services and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes the NVIDIA NeMo framework. \nIncluded in NeMo are prompt tuning, supervised fine-tuning and knowledge retrieval tools to help developers build, customize and deploy language models for enterprise use cases. NeMo Guardrails software is also included and enables developers to easily add topical, safety and security features for AI chatbots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling the creation of the industrial metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
