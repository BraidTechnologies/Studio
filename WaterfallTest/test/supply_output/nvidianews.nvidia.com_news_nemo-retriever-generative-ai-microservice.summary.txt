"NVIDIA has introduced NeMo Retriever, a generative AI microservice that enables enterprises to connect custom large language models to their data for accurate responses. NeMo Retriever enhances generative AI applications by providing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. Companies like Cadence, Dropbox, SAP, and ServiceNow are already using NeMo Retriever to improve the accuracy of their generative AI applications. Cadence is collaborating with NVIDIA to develop generative AI applications for industrial electronics design, using NeMo Retriever to improve accuracy and efficiency. NeMo Retriever allows users to connect to multiple data sources and obtain accurate answers using conversational prompts, and can be deployed on NVIDIA-accelerated computing."
