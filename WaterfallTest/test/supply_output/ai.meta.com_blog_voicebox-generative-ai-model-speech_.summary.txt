"Meta AI has created Voicebox, an advanced speech generation model that outperforms existing models with better word error rates and audio similarity. It can modify any part of a given sample using Flow Matching. While not available publicly, audio samples and a research paper have been shared. Voicebox is trained on diverse data and can be used for various speech-related tasks. The research also addresses potential misuse and provides a classifier to differentiate between authentic and generated speech. The researchers anticipate further advancements in speech generation technology."
