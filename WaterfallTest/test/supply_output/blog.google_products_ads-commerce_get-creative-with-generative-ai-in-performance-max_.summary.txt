"Google Ads is introducing generative AI features for marketers to create and scale assets for their campaigns. Marketers can experiment with different creative concepts and have control over the assets they want to include. 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. has used this approach to create high-quality visuals. Google Ads also offers an AI-powered image editor for easy enhancement of assets. AI-generated assets are identified with watermarking and metadata, and are being introduced in a beta version for advertisers in the U.S."
