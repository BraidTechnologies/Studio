To enable customers to realize the full potential of generative AI, HPE is partnering with NVIDIA to build systems with the required power, efficiency and scalability to support these applications.”\n“Generative AI can power unprecedented transformation but places unprecedented demands on enterprise infrastructure,” said Yuanqing Yang, chairman and CEO of Lenovo. “Working closely with NVIDIA, Lenovo is building efficient, accelerated systems with the networking, computing and software needed to power modern AI applications.”\nNetworking Purpose-Built to Accelerate AI\r\nFor peak AI workload efficiency, Spectrum-X combines the extreme performance of the Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch; the NVIDIA BlueField®-3 SuperNIC, a new class of network accelerators for supercharging hyperscale AI workloads; as well as acceleration software. Spectrum-X complements BlueField-3 DPUs, the world’s most advanced infrastructure computing platform.\nSpectrum-4 is the world’s first 51Tb/sec Ethernet switch for AI, providing highly effective data throughput at scale and under load while minimizing network congestion for multi-tenant, AI cloud workloads. Its intelligent, fine-tuned routing technology enables maximum utilization of network infrastructure at all times.\nBlueField-3 SuperNICs are designed for network-intensive, massively parallel computing, offering up to 400Gb/s RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) network connectivity between GPU servers and boosting performance for AI training and inference traffic on the east-west network inside the cluster. They also enable secure, multi-tenant data center environments, ensuring deterministic and isolated performance between tenant jobs. Boasting a power-efficient, half-height, half-length PCIe form factor, BlueField-3 SuperNICs are ideal for enterprise-class servers.\nAcceleration software powering Spectrum-X features NVIDIA software development kits such as Cumulus Linux, Pure SONiC and NetQ — which together drive the platform’s breakthrough performance — and the NVIDIA DOCA™ software framework, which is at the heart of BlueField.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides frameworks, pretrained models and development tools for secure, stable and supported production AI. NVIDIA AI Workbench allows developers to quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models on a PC or workstation — then scale them to virtually any data center or cloud.\nNVIDIA Israel-1 Supercomputer Powered by Spectrum-X\r\nSpectrum-X also enables the NVIDIA Israel-1 supercomputer, a reference architecture for next-generation AI systems. Israel-1 is a collaboration with Dell Technologies, using Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers powered by the NVIDIA HGX™ H100 eight-GPU platform and BlueField-3 DPUs and SuperNICs with Spectrum-4 switches.\nAvailability\r\nNew systems from Dell, HPE and Lenovo featuring the complete NVIDIA AI stack are expected in the first quarter of next year.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
