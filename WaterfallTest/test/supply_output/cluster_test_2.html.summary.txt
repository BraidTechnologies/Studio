"Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, especially large language models, have led to the development of various generative AI systems, including chatbots like ChatGPT and Copilot, AI image generation systems like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, and text-to-video AI generators like Sora. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu, along with smaller firms, have contributed to these developments."
