"Multimodal generative AI systems combine different types of inputs to generate outputs. Safety mechanisms detect inappropriate content. The model predicts the next word based on combined input information. The output is refined and delivered through Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Tips are given for controlling, customizing, and enhancing the AI system's output, as well as managing privacy and data usage. It's important to understand AI's limitations."
