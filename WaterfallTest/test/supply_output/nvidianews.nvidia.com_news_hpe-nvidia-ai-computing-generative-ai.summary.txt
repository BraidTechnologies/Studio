"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NVIDIA have partnered to create a portfolio of AI solutions called \"NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE.\" The aim is to accelerate the adoption of generative AI by providing a flexible path for developing and deploying AI applications. System integrators like Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro will support the offerings. HPE and NVIDIA have also developed a turnkey private cloud solution for enterprise AI, addressing complexities and risks associated with fragmented AI technology. The HPE GreenLake cloud services offer manageability and observability for hybrid environments, while OpsRamp integrates with HPE GreenLake to provide observability and AIOps for the NVIDIA computing stack. Additionally, HPE has announced support for NVIDIA's latest GPUs, CPUs, and Superchips, and the HPE Apollo ay XD670 server with NVIDIA H200 NVLink is set to be available this summer."
