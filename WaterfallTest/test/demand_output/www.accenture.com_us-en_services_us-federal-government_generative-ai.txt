language models (LLMs) will transform federal enterprises and missions by enabling natural, user-focused interactions with agency-specific data.\nAt the outset of mainstream adoption, AI was primarily used to answer questions. Today, AI can be a partner in creation. Generative AI offers powerful new ways to converse, synthesize, and generate realistic text and multimedia content.\nAccording to Accenture research, up to 40% of all working hours will soon be supported or augmented by language-based AI. For public sector organizations, 39% of working hours have a higher potential for automation or augmentation.\nGenerative AI will empower federal agencies to increase efficiency, improve stakeholder experiences, and better address mission challenges. What can it do for your agency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n        Intelligence synthesis & discovery\n    \nQuickly derive information from large amounts of text data, presenting pathways for analyst insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n        Assistive coding & vulnerability research\n    \nEnable more efficient programming by providing code scaffolding and generating comments, documentation, and unit tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n        Conversational services & customer communications\n    \nCreate real-time customer response communications for help desks and citizen services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n        Knowledge management & enterprise data transformation\n    \nEnable conversational interaction with enterprise data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n        Content generation & design inspiration\n    \nGenerate content in a specific style, or mock concept and prototype design examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccenture Federal Services Applied Intelligence brings the latest advances in generative AI to the federal space. Balancing innovation with safety, security, and risk management, we support agencies from strategic assessments through the development and deployment of scalable generative AI applications.\nWe have experience operationalizing generative AI for mission impact. Our 750+ data scientists, engineers, and AI/ML SMEs apply emerging technologies to federal use cases in complex environments.\nWe deliver:\nEnterprise strategies to unlock value and insights in legacy dataPeople-first user experiencesCloud and on-prem solutions to fit mission needsFederal-specific generative AI offerings, including FedGPT, our solution for generative AI models tailored to federal requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal generative AI, enabling faster mission outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are delivering generative AI capabilities to federal clients in our Next-Gen Mission Analytics (NMA) platform.\nNMA is an open-source intelligence platform which delivers near real-time pattern and behavioral analysis of various data, allowing users to curate more than 100,000 global media sources through a common operating picture.\nIn NMA, analysts can now interact with a generative chat interface using natural language to automatically create complex search strings structured in NMA’s querying language.\nThese queries create custom, on-demand visualizations from a repository of millions of open-source documents. Additionally, analysts are now enabled to interact with data in their native language. The hours analysts spend researching, finding topics, translating, and structuring queries are now reduced to minutes.\nWe applied our responsible AI framework to this use case, implementing guardrails to protect against erroneous or biased outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of NMA’s UI with the generative AI chatbot on the right formatting a user’s input in NMA’s query language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION (Versatile Intelligence System for Information and Operation Needs) empowers federal leaders to make informed, data-driven decisions on multifaceted issues such as conflicts, crises and disaster response by combining human judgment with models and simulations.\nWorking from a human-generated prompt (e.g., how can the U.S. strengthen the semiconductor supply chain?), VISION automatically generates the following:\nPotential scenariosFactors driving the scenariosStakeholders in each scenarioStakeholders' estimated positions on the issue\nThese outputs feed into models and simulations which estimate likely outcomes, providing a starting point for further analysis. Before VISION, generating potential outcomes required hundreds of specialized person-hours.\nAt every step, a human remains involved to check the model’s accuracy and account for bias. VISION provides a baseline analysis in minutes; the result is accelerated, data-driven research to predict collective group behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust at the core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more from Generative AI Lead Mike Thieme on the top five focus areas for federal generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI brings new challenges to government agencies, including risks of data leakage, adversarial use of generative tools, and potentially incorrect outputs from trained models.\nOur approach to mitigating risks in generative AI for federal agencies is rooted in five core principles:\nTrustworthy: Safe, honest, and diverse in perspectivesReliable: Designed to enhance judgement and decision-makingUnderstandable: Interpretable and transparent in decision-makingSecure: Prioritizing privacy and the security of agency dataTeachable: Human-centric design supports human + machine co-creation\nOur team continually assesses the generative AI landscape, bridging commercial innovation and federal priorities to build strategies and solutions that meet mission needs.\n\n\n\nREAD OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE TOP FEDERAL IMPACT AREAS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFedGPT: generative AI tailored for federal use\n\n\n\n\nFedGPT delivers generative AI capabilities to fit federal requirements and use cases with explainable, accurate and traceable outputs.
