This technology has the power to reinvent every facet of an organization. This is new. Through our work, we see empirical evidence that this trend is already in motion, particularly as generative AI rapidly disrupts every industry.\nDisruption meets its match\nOrganizations are still operating in an unsettled landscape. The annual Accenture Pulse of Change Index found the rate of change affecting businesses has risen steadily since 2019 — 183% over the past four years. In response, 83% of organizations have accelerated the execution of their transformation since last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruption is up 33% year-on-year\n\n\n\n Accenture Pulse of Change: 2024 Index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinvention landscape\nMany organizations are keen to reinvent — some are further along in their journey than others.\nA small number of “Reinventors” (9%) have already met the high bar of building the capability for continuous reinvention. They’re making swift progress in executing their strategy and setting out to define a new performance frontier with technology at the core of their reinvention journey.\nAmong the largest companies, especially those with revenues over US$50bn, the number of Reinventors has quadrupled in the past year. Industry giants are not standing still. Unlike the digital revolution, the largest companies are taking an early lead, leveraging their substantial investment in building their digital cores and talent. Two industries saw double-digit increases in the number of Reinventors: in software and platforms the figure is up 34 percentage points to 43%, and in life sciences it’s up 13 percentage points to 20%.\nMost organizations are still at the beginning of their reinvention journey, with few reinventing at scale today. Similar to last year, the majority (81%) are “Transformers.” Transformers should keep going. They are taking many of the right steps toward reinvention — however, they are less likely to be building sustainable capabilities to reinvent continuously and may be missing the speed and cost efficiencies from a connected strategy of reinvention. And we see a financial performance difference, with Reinventors pulling ahead. The remaining 10% of “Optimizers” are organizations where reinvention isn’t currently a priority.\nReinventors are creating an imperative for others to act.\nWe expect Reinventors to grow the value gap significantly in the next three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: 2019-22 = CAGR based on actuals. 2023-26 = self-reported expectations from the Accenture reinvention survey, stress-tested vs. analyst expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy generative AI shouldn’t be underestimated\nIn the past several decades, we haven’t seen any other technology with the potential to materially impact every aspect of a company — this is why we connect generative AI and reinvention. The only way to realize generative AI’s full potential is to embrace the need to reinvent processes and talent, while managing the technology through a new capability commonly referred to as responsible AI — and with a digital core that has a data and generative AI backbone.\nGenerative AI has become an extraordinary force in enabling reinvention and accelerating organizations’ progress toward a new performance frontier. Some understand this potential and are taking action. We’re seeing this among Reinventors, and also among a group of Transformers that we expect to leapfrog today's leaders by applying generative AI more intensively to their business.\nWhat Reinventors know:\nGenerative AI is unique in its ability to impact the entire value chain and to drive productivity and growth in a way that establishes a new performance frontier.\n\nAchieving reinvention through generative AI is only possible by developing end-to-end business capabilities, rather than the more common function-by-function focus on individual use cases.\n\nDeveloping end-to-end capabilities requires extensive and coordinated changes across processes, people and technology. Processes need to be redefined, people need to be reskilled and a data and generative AI backbone needs to be built into the digital core.\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI in action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3M hours saved\n\nA government agency responsibly used the latest digital technologies to deliver automations at speed and scale, saving three million operational hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16M customer offerings\n\nA bank delivered 16 million hyper-personalized offerings to customers within three months of building a generative AI-powered marketing solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+10% revenues\n\nAn insurer is reinventing the entire workflow of underwriting with the potential to increase revenues by 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinventing today to lead tomorrow\nGenerative AI represents a clear opportunity to accelerate reinvention. Based on delivering more than 700 generative AI client engagements and our research, we see five imperatives that the C-suite must address to reinvent how their businesses operate. We explore these imperatives, showcasing examples from our clients to illustrate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    01\n                \n\n\n\n\n                    Lead with Value\n                \n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShift the focus from siloed use cases to prioritizing business capabilities across the entire value chain, based on an objective assessment of the business case, enterprise readiness and the corresponding return on investment. Companies can pursue generative AI investments in two categories: \"no regrets\" investments that offer productivity improvements and \"strategic bets\" that offer truly novel competitive advantage including reshaping how industries operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 1\n\nUnderstand the potential to reinvent your value chain and develop end-to-end capabilities powered by generative AI and new ways of working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 2\n\nBe value-led in every business capability you choose to reinvent with generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 3\n\nIdentify strategic bets where the technology creates differentiated sources of value that can’t be easily captured by competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 4\n\nReorient your organization from siloed functions to end-to-end business capabilities and decision-making through a unified data architecture and cross-functional teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoche: Dissolving boundaries to deliver data-driven cancer care\nRealizing the potential for tailoring care to each person requires a new way of working that breaks down barriers across the lifecycle of care that a patient receives. \nRoche is building platforms that aggregate data from disparate sources. One such platform is its oncology hub, which securely makes sense of all patient data and gives clinicians a central workspace for collaboration. This helps to get patients into treatment faster in a field where time can save lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    02\n                \n\n\n\n\n                    Understand and develop an AI-enabled, secure digital core\n                \n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies need to elevate IT for the age of generative AI. Connect disparate data sets and technologies via an AI-enabled, secure digital core. Generative AI requires a fundamentally different enterprise architecture in which data is more fluid, and unstructured and synthetic data become much more important. It places higher demands on infrastructure, and IT operating models will need to change. Reinventors prioritize their digital core as a key competency.\n\nExplore our new  “Reinventing with a Digital Core” research report to learn more about the benefits of a reinvention-ready digital core. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 1 \n\nUnderstand what “digital core” means for you and look at your technology objectively to understand where your digital core is — relative to the industry, and most important, relative to what is needed to use generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 2 \n\nUnderstand the new capabilities required for a data and generative AI backbone and what it will take to build them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 3\n\nEnsure your CIO is embedding cyber security practices early in the lifecycle across technology and that you have a strong security culture to prioritize resiliency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 4\n\nUnderstand your current technology and advisory ecosystem, and refresh your strategy on how you will work with them to compress the reinvention cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 5 \n\nRigorously measure the progress toward ensuring more than 50% of your technology investments are targeted at building the new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asian national oil company: Simplifying volumes of data\nThis client has huge volumes of data in different formats — and generates more daily. After taking a holistic look at the issues, it deployed generative AI and cognitive search to realize the true value of its data and drive new growth. \nIts new knowledge base incorporates more than 250,000 documents with structured and unstructured information, surfaces the desired information and converts it into a chosen format.

Companies must quickly clarify how work needs to be reinvented and reshape the workforce accordingly. This will require skills-based HR and continuous learning across all levels of the workforce, including the C-suite. Success requires putting people at the heart of change, and it will mean leaders with different skills. As leaders acquire necessary new skills for the age of generative AI along with the workforce, they can better drive reinvention across entire value chains and business processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 1\n\nCreate a talent strategy that identifies how work will change, documents the impact to roles and assesses what skills are needed for every generative AI use case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 2 \n\nBuild strong people-centric change competencies that are the same across functions and business processes to fully understand the impact of generative AI on people and their experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 3 \n\nDevelop, either organically or with partners, the continuous learning capabilities needed to support reinvention. Prepare workers for generative AI, actively involving them in change and ensuring they have market-relevant skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 4 \n\nReview HR capabilities and invest in the competencies and technology needed to support the reinvention vision.

Given generative AI’s speed of evolution and adoption, these risks need to be a focus now to avoid challenges later, including regulatory costs. The vast majority (96%) of organizations support some level of government regulation around AI, but just 2% of companies have self-identified as having fully operationalized responsible AI across their organization. Closing the gap requires a plan that moves from commitment and frameworks to action on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 1 \n\nAgree and adopt responsible AI principles with clear accountability and governance for design, deployment and usage of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction 2\n\nConduct AI risk assessment.

MAS established Veritas, an industry consortium, to help financial services institutions (FSIs) evaluate their AI and data analytics solutions against the principles of fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency. A core team within Veritas developed a methodology framework to operationalize those principles. This helps FSIs gain value from AI responsibly while building a fairer future for billions of consumers worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    05\n                \n\n\n\n\n                    Drive continuous reinvention\n                \n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange is constant, so reinvention never ends. Leaders cannot approach reinvention as a contained effort undertaken every few years. They must build the capability to continuously reinvent. Enterprises that not only survive disruption but come out on top are those that are in perpetual motion. Companies must constantly build their organizational agility. It’s a switch to a state of openness to new thinking, requiring a cultural and operational mindset for continuous change, powered by a flexible digital core that supports generative AI at pace and at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere could reinvention take your business?\nOur industry-specific diagnostics help organizations shape a blueprint for successful reinvention and define how best to use generative AI across the enterprise.
