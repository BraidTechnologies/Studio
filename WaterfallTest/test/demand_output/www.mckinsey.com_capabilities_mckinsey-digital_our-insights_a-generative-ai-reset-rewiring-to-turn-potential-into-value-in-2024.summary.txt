"Companies face challenges when trying to harness the value of generative AI. To succeed, they should focus on innovation, scalability, and productivity improvements. It is important to implement gen AI tools, form cross-functional teams, identify high-impact areas, upskill the workforce, and establish centralized teams. Operationalizing gen AI models at scale can be simplified through efficient connections, testing, and data optimization. Trust, reusability, and policies regarding data privacy, security, bias risk, job displacement, and intellectual property protection are crucial. Establishing tests and documenting decisions aid in conversations with regulators."
