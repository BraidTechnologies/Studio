"The text highlights the importance for Chief Data Officers (CDOs) to prioritize value, necessary data, and specific capabilities in the data architecture. It also emphasizes the need for high-quality data, protection of sensitive data, and a skilled data engineering team. CDOs should use generative AI for data management and promote collaboration between data and business teams. They should prioritize initiatives that provide broad benefits, build data architecture capabilities, and improve data-handling protocols, governance, and quality. CDOs should also track and manage progress in generative AI initiatives and define core KPIs for measuring success."
