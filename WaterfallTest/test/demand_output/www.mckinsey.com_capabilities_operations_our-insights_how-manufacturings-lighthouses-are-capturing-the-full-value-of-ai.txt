DOWNLOADSArticle (11 pages)\nThe first article in this series explored the evolution of AI and how leading manufacturers have harnessed it to redefine the leading edge of manufacturing. It looked at the acceleration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) from learning to doing. This second of three articles explores what AI looks like at the leading edge of manufacturing today. The final installment will explore the capabilities that the latest Lighthouses have built to deploy AI and other 4IR technologies with both speed and scale.\nShare SidebarAbout the authorsThis article is a collaborative effort by Henry Bristol, Enno de Boer, Dinu de Kroon, Forest Hou, Rahul Shahani, and Federico Torti, representing views from McKinsey’s Operations Practice and the World Economic Forum.\nLighthouses are the standard-bearers of manufacturing and supply chains. And increasingly, they are looking to AI to power their Industry 4.0 transformations. Whereas less than 20 percent of top use cases in the first three membership waves of the Global Lighthouse Network relied on AI technologies, now nearly 60 percent of the top use cases implemented by the 21 newest Lighthouses announced in December 2023 utilize AI (Exhibit 1). This comes as no surprise: AI-based use cases in this latest cohort alone have seen remarkable results, including a two to three times increase in productivity, a 50 percent improvement in service levels, a 99 percent reduction in defects, and a 30 percent decrease in energy consumption.\nExhibit 1We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world’s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nCITIC Pacific Special Steel, a special steel manufacturer in China, has identified dozens of applications for AI across its production process, including by predicting the inner workings of its blast furnaces to optimize process parameters in real time, increasing throughput by 15 percent while reducing energy consumption by 11 percent. Agilent, a life sciences equipment manufacturer in Germany, assetized its computer vision technology into a tool kit so effective that it enabled the deployment of five distinct computer vision use cases that reduced defect rates by 49 percent in just four months.\nThese technologies are maturing rapidly as companies improve the confidence intervals on AI’s predictions and recommendations. As belief in these models exceeds the confidence in planners or operators, factories such as Mondelēz’s baking facility in Beijing provide a glimpse into what this can look like, where frontline workers are more technicians than machine operators. Not only are they achieving more than two times the productivity improvements, but they are also seeing up to a 70 percent reduction in waste and 10 to 25 percent reductions in energy consumption.\nShare SidebarLighthouses offer five insights into results-driven adoption of AI and gen AIAI use cases are prolific across the whole operations value chain\nEach of the 21 newest Lighthouses has at least one applied AI use case; some have dozens. Collectively, these 50-plus use cases span all domains, from planning to manufacturing to delivery and beyond.\nAI can be assetized to enable deployment at speed and scale\nLighthouses are packaging AI use cases using deployment productivity tools (for example, no-code platforms), modular design principles, off-the-shelf test integrators, and digital upskilling materials in each asset package that they deploy.\nAI command centers are enabling next-level and system-level automation\nAI command centers connect across end-to-end   operations, with cognitive automations to put humans “on” the loop, not “in” it. To do this, Lighthouses “train for trust” with clear, low-risk ways to increase confidence intervals while mitigating and alerting of potential risks.\nGen AI is extending AI’s impact beyond the shop floor\nEvery site is piloting generative AI (gen AI) in the latest Lighthouse cohort. Pilots are primarily where data is most unstructured: for instance, as design advisers or for supplier risk forecasting. Gen AI is also a shortcut to shop floor productivity: for example, auto-PFMEA (process failure mode effect analysis) or “technician advisers.”\nGen AI is speeding past pilots, too\nMost gen AI pilots have been implemented in days and weeks, not months and years. Lighthouse capabilities have advanced the starting line versus five years ago; existing talent, agile, tech, and data capabilities are enabling speed and scale of emerging technologies like gen AI.\nIf the rapid adoption of generative AI (gen AI) tools in banking and technology is anything to learn from, it’s likely that, for Lighthouses, at least, impact at a factory scale will be just around the corner. The knowledge, skills, and data foundations Lighthouses have built as they’ve moved past pilots for other 4IR technologies will likewise prove relevant for gen AI. This is true for ACG Capsules, a pharmaceuticals contract manufacturer in Pithampur, India, which fully developed and deployed a a copilot to interface with standard operating procedures (SOPs) in less than five weeks, achieving a 40 percent reduction in mean time to repair (MTTR) and, when paired with a virtual reality–enabled training solution, a nearly 40 percent reduction in technician onboarding time.\nShare SidebarWhy AI is defining the Fourth Industrial Revolution The true power of AI for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) stems from its position at the top of a pyramid of 4IR technologies; it is playing the role of conductor for 4IR technologies, which together perform a symphony of impact (Exhibit A).\nExhibit AWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nConsider the example of a rapid changeover at a production site (Exhibit B). This requires flexible robotics to handle different products, automated guided vehicles to move materials and parts, 3-D printing to customize line fixtures, and wearable technology to keep managers and technicians informed with real-time data. What orchestrates this complex interplay of elements, each of which is individually complex? The answer: AI.\nExhibit BWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nBut AI needs terabytes of data generated by and collected from a broad range of sources: enterprise systems, machine sensors, connectivity infrastructure, and human workers. That’s why the most advanced front-runners are ahead. They had the foresight to make investments and take on risks involved in building the data foundations that are needed to power AI technologies and unlock their potential impact.\nAI is advancing to impact quickly and is only speeding up. Manufacturers no longer need to ponder whether it’s possible or impactful. Lighthouses have already proved that. Instead, they need to focus on the risks, regulations, and complexities of responsible AI implementation—a critical topic worthy of its own publication. Lighthouses are not immune to these risks, and they have not been overly bullish. They have taken a measured approach, ensuring they have the expertise, systems, and leadership to reap the benefits of AI responsibly.\nShare SidebarWhat is generative AI?Generative AI’s (gen AI’s) differentiating factor is that it can pay attention to patterns across immense unstructured data sets. It leverages a transformer architecture to generate embeddings, an approach initially designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Embeddings are massive vectors representing hundreds of thousands of parameters for any given token or piece of information. (For text-based models, a token might be as small as the prefix “un.”) It can predict or generate content by identifying a probability that any one token will sequentially follow another token. This probability calculation accounts for the proximity of that token’s vector embedding with others stored in the database, often referred to as the large language model or foundation model.1QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, “Embeddings: The language of LLMs and genAI,” Medium, October 4, 2023.\nTo pick or generate sequences of tokens, one deep learning model predicts subsequent tokens, while another analyzes and scores the selection—which is exactly why gen AI is often referred to as a generative adversarial network. This unique approach is what enables gen AI to begin to process troves of unstructured data to emulate true human reasoning and connection, synthesize insights, generate content, and generally “humanize” user interactions.\nMore than 50 ways to put gen AI’s cognition capability to work in operations\nGen AI’s transformer architecture and massive data sets make it uniquely capable of accomplishing the following:\n\nInsight extraction. Gen AI can rapidly search large corpora of text and visuals to identify relevant patterns and draw insights in real time, which has high value in areas where data is unstructured: for example, discovering new supplier profiles or prescreening bids.\nContent generation. Gen AI can compose new content in the shape of text, visuals, or sounds. It takes millions of inputs and produces completely new data that is unique and tailored: for example, creating a quality performance report or writing an audit memo.\nUser interaction. Gen AI can engage in humanlike conversation, hold onto context memory, and present seemingly creative thoughts. This might take the shape of a chatbot that role-plays supplier negotiations or one that provides shipping updates.\n\nOur research across both the latest Lighthouses and our clients shows more than 50 high-potential use cases for gen AI in manufacturing and supply chains, spanning six domains (design, source, plan, make, deliver, serve) and two capability areas (data and technology deployment, talent and organization enablement). To learn more about the many use cases for gen AI in operations, check out our latest blog post, “Generative AI will first be successfully scaled in business operations.”\nTogether, the latest class of Lighthouses gives us five insights into what AI looks like at manufacturing’s leading edge (see sidebar “Lighthouses offer five insights into results-driven adoption of AI and gen AI”) and its role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (see sidebars “Why AI is defining the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and “What is generative AI?”). This article will explore each insight in detail.\nAI in every process\nMost Popular InsightsMcKinsey technology trends outlook 2024What to read next: McKinsey’s 2024 annual book recommendationsThe loneliest job? How top CEOs manage dilemmas and vulnerabilityThe hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transitionThe state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nEarly AI pilots focused on individual process steps, where the scope was smallest, risks were lowest, and iterations were fastest. Even today, more than 80 percent of Lighthouse use cases involving AI are likewise executed at the process step level. What’s notable, though, is that AI is having significant impact at every supply chain process step—including planning, asset management, quality, and delivery.\nThe most recent cohort of Lighthouses demonstrates this breadth and diversity. Consider planning, where Ingrasys deployed an AI-demand forecasting model that uses past data to train the model; in just three years, the changes have increased forecast accuracy by 27 percent. Or process optimization, where Hengtong Alpha Optic-Electric automatically optimizes preform and drawing parameters with a model trained on past strategies. Or quality, where VitrA Karo deployed computer vision in its kiln, which decreased the scrap rate by 68 percent. Or delivery, where China Resources Building Materials Technology has adaptively optimized heavy-transport equipment routes to decrease pickup lead times by 39 percent (Exhibit 2).\nExhibit 2We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nDemocratizing AI with assetization\nAchieving these impact levels—20 percent, 40 percent, or even 60 percent improvements across critical KPIs such as throughput, quality, and delivery performance—has required Lighthouses to scale past pilots and proof of concepts (POCs) to full implementation of use cases across every machine and production line. Some undertook their own four- or five-year journeys to pilot, learn, and scale new technologies and use cases. Others—such as CATL in Liyang, China; Unilever in Sonepat, India; and Johnson & Johnson   in Xi’an, China—were able to leverage the learnings of their companies’ other Lighthouse sites to design for scale from day one. They applied advanced AI and other technologies across numerous processes, skipping the steep learning curve that the earliest Lighthouses had no choice but to overcome.\nOne of the ways that today’s Lighthouses have sped past pilots is with a strategic focus on “assetization”: that is, the art and science of packaging use cases for speed and scale of deployment. Other industries are also taking this approach: high AI performers are now 1.6 times more likely than other organizations to create AI applications using emerging low-code or no-code programs, allowing them to speed up the process of development even further.1“The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in review,” McKinsey, December 6, 2022.\nWould you like to learn more about our Operations Practice?Visit our Manufacturing & Supply Chain page\nLighthouses are already demonstrating how this approach works in the manufacturing sector. They are leveraging modular design principles to ensure interoperability with existing technology architecture. They are investing in—and then leveraging—deployment productivity tools such as no-code platforms for customizable interfaces. And they are including basic digital upskilling materials, such as walkthrough videos and SOPs, as part of the asset packages that they deploy, which are accessible to any user. This is how new use cases and digital innovations can go from being a localized tool to a company-wide asset that is used everywhere and tailored locally.\nAgilent did exactly this. It built an in-house, ready-to-deploy AI solution library for detecting anomalies and responding to process deviations, bundling computer vision tools with plug-in connectors to manufacturing execution systems and test software, as well as packaging with SOPs, user documentations, and training guides for operators. This democratization of computer vision technology empowers technicians—not just engineers—to identify, deploy, and test new camera and vision applications end to end. This enabled Agilent to deploy five new applications across 57 work centers and 16 product lines, achieving a 49 percent defect rate reduction in less than four months.\nOn the horizon: Command centers for system-level automation\nSmart homes don’t just build on centuries of progressively improving heating, cooling, lighting, and other technologies. They bring it all together with intelligent controls, automatically managing ambient temperatures, self-tending fireplaces, adjusting blinds, and obedience to vocal commands to play the perfect music or provide guidance on when to leave to catch the nearest subway. Smart factories are no different; their impact comes from similarly centralized intelligence with higher levels of decision-making capabilities—and placing their humans “on” the loop instead of “in” it.\nAutomating cognitive processes\nLike physical automations, these cognitive automations come in stages. In the first, they apply intelligence to maintain steady-state operational processes, such as using AI to set process parameters in real time. Second, they (correctly) identify restorative actions—for instance, suggesting a corrective action for a machine underperformance or recommending a recipe adjustment to compensate for an input material impurity—with humans in the loop. Finally, they evolve to full “self-healing” manufacturing and supply chain operations, with humans on the loop.\nShare SidebarCommand centers for cognitive automation: Two casesMondelēz, a global snack-food manufacturer with a plant in Beijing, China, constructed a dough production workshop with an AI control center spanning five automated production lines, four intelligent guided vehicles, and nine ingredients in the supply chain. It optimizes the dough fermentation process, analyzes its consistency for accuracy, and improves capacity and speed across the entire production line and relevant supply chains. In the face of climate change-induced volatility in the water supply, South Korea’s K-water deployed an “AI operations system” controlling processes like mixing and sedimentation. This helped increase production volume by 31 percent in just two years, and work is under way on scaling to 42 other plants.\nBoth companies have centralization of intelligence. They are beyond applying AI to individual process steps and have adopted AI command centers that operate across the full production system. These solutions make the more difficult and responsive operational decisions, such as when new information emerges about a material shortage, or when a special priority order comes in, or when an energy source is impacted requiring rapid line rebalancing. AI, unhindered by the limitations of insufficient memory, can sift simultaneously through millions of data points, understand them, and optimize the mechanisms that connect them all—the next step toward a factory where technicians are the new operators.\nMost Lighthouses have already achieved the first two. They are also accelerating toward the third—the technological achievement that underpins the concept of lights-out operations, where factories will achieve next-level improvements in productivity, quality, and service levels, and where the new front line will look more akin to augmented technicians than they will to the operators of today. Two new Lighthouses—Mondelēz and K-water—offer a look at this evolution (see sidebar “Command centers for cognitive automation: Two cases”).\nTraining for trust\nIn order to facilitate true system-level decision automation, AI not only needs to identify corrective actions—it is imperative that recommendations are trusted to be correct every time. This is true for all types of AI, including applied, generative, and others on the horizon. To address this, Lighthouses are prioritizing closed-loop feedback to improve their models and increase confidence intervals well before handing over control. They are also integrating safeguards, monitoring mechanisms and overrides for risk safety.\nThere are multiple ways to build trust with AI models—and this year’s Lighthouses exhibit several. One regularly retrains models on retroactive data, comparing past predictions with actual operator decisions and process performance, tuning until accuracy rates exceed that of humans. In another case, simulation can help; advanced techniques such as digital twins and AI-based simulation models can simulate the impact of recommended actions on metrics such as material availability, customer requirement matching, and machine uptime. This can rapidly improve the accuracy of cognitive decision making with a reduced need for experimentation. In a third case, models can be phased in—used first for human augmentation (that is, as a decision aid)—and their decisions can be given a probability score of being the same one made by a well-informed human. Operators can then vote on the recommendations, such as inventory replenishment levels or specific maintenance actions, to train and improve the models dynamically until they surpass the probability threshold, ready for true automation.\nGen AI innovations extend impact into the value chain\nShare SidebarGen AI and engineering design: A hypotheticalA first-year engineer asks generative AI to mock up a 3-D model for some changes to their company’s newest wind turbine blades. The engineer then has the platform coordinate dozens of analytic simulations leveraging applied AI models. The platform generates a full report of potential product performance, documenting two areas for design improvement and one compliance issue. The engineer engages a design adviser, which references past company designs and even web-scraped information on competitor products to generate iterations. After a few hours of back-and-forth, the engineer has a high-quality, cost-optimized, and fully simulated design that is as good as, if not better than, the ones produced by their more seasoned peers.\nGenerative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in annual value2“The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023. to the global economy—nearly a quarter of which could be captured by productivity improvements of up to two times and task automations of nearly 70 percent across manufacturing- and supply chain-related activities, primarily driven by new capabilities in content generation, insights extraction, and user interaction (see sidebar “Gen AI and engineering design: A hypothetical”).3“The great acceleration: CIO perspectives on generative AI: How technology leaders are adopting emerging tools to deliver enterprise-wide AI,” MIT Technology Review, July 18, 2023.\nWe are trying to use generative AI to help fresh engineers quickly learn those basic rules. Can we help engineers and college graduates, after half a year learning the [gen AI] tool, to become an independent designer?Ni Jun, chief manufacturing officer, CATL, and professor at Shanghai University; Source: Lighthouses Live 2023\nLighthouses have realized this potential and are bringing gen AI to areas where data is most unstructured. This includes areas of product development and procurement-related activities such as with Ni Jun’s vision for design advisers, people enablement with technician advisers, SOP-instructing chatbots, and personalized trainers, and in technology implementation with use cases such as software development copilots—one of gen AI’s most common implementations.\nThese kinds of use cases could enable robust digital transformations to happen faster than the two- to three-year sweet spot maintained by conventional wisdom. It’s no wonder then that 100 percent of new Lighthouses—known for their desire for speed and scale of I4.0—have at least one gen AI pilot under way; and some have more than five.\nSpeeding past pilots for gen AI, too\nBack in 2019, when applied AI use cases were predominantly pilots and POCs, many factories were still building their data and technology foundations, ascertaining which new skills their workforces needed to have and developing strategies for successful implementation. At the time, the leadership from Lighthouses was in getting new use cases to real impact, even after potentially many pilots. But fast-forward to today, and Lighthouses are even further ahead, sometimes skipping pilots altogether. In fact, the time it takes new Lighthouses to implement new AI use cases has fallen by nearly 25 percent compared with earlier cohorts. This means that the starting line for emerging technologies such as gen AI is far more advanced than it was for applied AI five years ago.\nACG Capsules is a prime example of accelerated deployment of gen AI. Seeking to address the changing needs for employee skill sets in manufacturing, the company developed and deployed an SOP- and policy-interfacing gen AI assistant in just two weeks.\nWithin just five weeks, after some transfer learning and fine-tuning, the gen AI assistant was already being used by nearly three-quarters of operators and technicians to inform maintenance and compliance actions. As a result, ACG saw a 40 percent reduction in MTTR and unplanned downtime.\n\nLighthouse sites underscore the potential of AI in manufacturing, and Lighthouse companies are pressing the advantage they’ve built. Catching up will require fast followers to make quick, judicious moves to fill critical gaps—not only technological but also strategic and human. There’s no time to lose.\nFor more on the full World Economic Forum report upon which this article is based, see Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting\nAI at speed and scale, World Economic Forum, December 2023.\nIn the final article in this series, we will explore the six capabilities that Lighthouses have built to deploy AI with speed and scale.About the author(s)Henry Bristol is a consultant in McKinsey’s Dallas   office, Enno de Boer is a senior partner in the New Jersey office, Dinu de Kroon is a partner in the Zurich office, Forest Hou is a partner in the Shanghai office, Rahul Shahani is a partner in the New York office, and Federico Torti is an initiatives lead at the World Economic Forum’s Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains.Talk to usExplore a career with usSearch OpeningsRelated ArticlesArticleAdopting AI at speed and scale: The 4IR push to stay competitiveArticleThe continuing evolution of the Global Lighthouse NetworkPodcast114 down, 10 million to go: The Global Lighthouse Network’s missionSign up for our Monthly Highlights newsletterDon't miss this roundup of our newest and most distinctive insightsSubscribeSign up for our Monthly Highlights newsletterWe use cookies to give you the best possible experience with mckinsey.com.
