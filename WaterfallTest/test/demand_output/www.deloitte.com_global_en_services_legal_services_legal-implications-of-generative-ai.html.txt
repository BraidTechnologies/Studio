Generative AI\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile definitions can vary, the EU AI Act defines Generative AI as \"foundation models used in AI systems specifically intended to generate, with varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex text, images, audio, or video.\" (Art. 28b (4) AI Act)\nAs businesses explore how to use these new tools, there are potential concerns for enterprise stakeholders, particularly legal and compliance professionals.\nGenerally, a legal executive’s role in examining the use of Generative AI is to knowledgeably advise stakeholders (i.e., business leaders, executive peers, the board, and others) on the risks associated with business applications of Generative AI. To this end, it is helpful to understand how Generative AI works and the risk implications the technology presents.\nHere we look at some common legal issues arising in the Generative AI space. Because regulatory frameworks applicable to Generative AI are emerging and quickly evolving, this article avoids a comprehensive discussion of existing or proposed regulations, except where a particular example might provide a better understanding of the relevant risks. And there’s even more in the full report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the legal implications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual property\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI can process vast quantities of data, and without much noteworthy human intervention, transform it into an AI-generated output. The discussion on how to treat any intellectual property rights arising in both the materials used to train the AI (input) and the results created by the AI (output) is still in its early days. To keep these issues comprehensible, we focus in our report on legal questions concerning copyright laws, but the same concepts are likely to be applicable to other sorts of protected IP. \n\n\n\nFind out more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal data and confidentiality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI systems both ingest and generate large amounts of data, including images, text, speech, video, code, business plans, and technical formulae. Training, testing, uploading, analyzing, consulting, or otherwise processing such input and output data requires various levels of protection.
