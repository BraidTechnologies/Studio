Its massive potential has captured the attention of business leaders across industries, with 95% of executives agreeing it will be transformative for their company. And 100% anticipating workforce changes as a result.\nThe implications for supply chain leaders? There are countless opportunities to apply generative AI across end-to-end supply chain networks. Performance gains are waiting to be tapped in everything from sourcing and planning, through manufacturing and fulfilment, to aftersales and service.\nThere’s also significant cross-functional value to be gained in areas like sustainability, customer-centricity, supply chain resilience and supply chain data analysis.\nSupply chain leaders that recognize this can act quickly to capitalize on generative AI’s rapid acceleration — and turn today’s immense promise into resetting the performance frontiers of tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Accenture research:\n\n\n\n43%\nof all working hours across end-to-end supply chain activities could be impacted by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n29%\nof working hours across supply chains could be automated by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n14%\nof working hours across supply chains could be significantly augmented by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is generative AI so powerful?\nGenerative AI promises to be the ‘missing link’ that helps bridge the gap from the linear supply chains of the past to the truly interconnected, intelligent supply chain networks of the future. Building on previous advances in supply chain management artificial intelligence — in areas like control tower visibility — generative AI offers a range of new capabilities:\nContextual understanding. Enhances forecasting and decision-making with contextualized insights from larger volumes of previously inaccessible unstructured data.\n\nConversational capabilities. Streamlines access to insights and creates new automation opportunities through user-friendly interactions with AI agents in everyday language.\n\nContent generation. Capable of creating relevant and usable content for augmenting and automating tasks in areas like sourcing, procurement, customer service and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is empowering supply chain talent to operate in smarter ways, think more strategically and drive even greater business value.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI’s impact\nOpportunities across end-to-end supply chain network operations:\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign and engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI can streamline design processes, using historical and external data sources to rapidly produce new designs to specification, reducing time and repetitive effort. Examples include generating new sustainable packaging designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI democratizes supply chain network insights, transforming the way people interact with planning tools and data. Examples include easier access to advanced data analytics tools and using new data sources to improve forecasting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI can streamline sourcing and procurement processes, generate new insights and increase automation of routine tasks. Examples include user-friendly chatbots for simpler buying, auto-generating purchase orders and drafting RFx documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI offers new insights and automations to drive up operational excellence across manufacturing. Examples include faster and simpler access to technical manuals, auto-generating maintenance plans, and drafting compliance documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFulfill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI elevates fulfilment operations, offering new insights that help create more personalized customer experiences. Examples include faster access to forecasting analytics, as well as streamlined shipping processes and documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI helps customer support agents access contextualized information and resolve incidents faster. Examples include intelligent copilots that summarize customer incidents, detect issues, recommend resolutions and compose responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​​Related insights​\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Next stop, next-gen\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Technology Vision 2024\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t A new era of Gen AI for everyone\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Work, workforce, workers\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Resiliency in the making\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Can you see your Scope 3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWRITTEN BY\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMaria Rey-Marston\n\n\t\t\t\tManaging Director – Strategy & Consulting, Supply Chain & Operations, Innovation Lead\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJaime R.
