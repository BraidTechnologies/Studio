"Generative AI is rapidly developing and could automate a significant portion of US working hours by 2030. This could lead to job displacement, but also create skilled and well-paid jobs. Investments in re-training and education are necessary for workers to adapt. Generative AI could contribute $10 trillion to US GDP and annual growth of 3%-4%, but workers need to acquire new skills. Training, recruiting from diverse populations, and managing worker transitions are emphasized for a sustainable and inclusive future."
