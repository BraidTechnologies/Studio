Leveraging the best organizational and technological capabilities, McKinsey is supporting leaders in harnessing the full value of generative AI.\nShare SidebarAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinseyQuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, unites more than 5,000 colleagues across more than 40 countries with five artificial intelligence R&D centers in London, New York, Gurgaon, São Paulo, and Tel Aviv – as well as broader ecosystem of more than thousand external partners including Stanford HAI, emerging generative AI leaders, and cloud hyperscalers. In collaboration with SAP Business AI, McKinsey is very excited and optimistic of the total value impact potential for customers.\nUsing NVIDIA technology, McKinsey has begun delivering impact for several clients.
