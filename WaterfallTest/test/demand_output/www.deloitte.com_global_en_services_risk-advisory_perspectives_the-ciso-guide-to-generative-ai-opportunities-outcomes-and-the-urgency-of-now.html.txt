It holds an immense potential to fortify your organization’s cybersecurity, making investigations more efficient, and speeding up risk assessments. With proper governance and strategic implementation, cyber leaders can leverage Gen AI to reinforce their organization against breaches, address talent shortages, and develop effective roadmaps for threat detection and response.\nOur recently published paper, The CISO’s guide to Generative AI - Opportunities, outcomes, and the urgency of now explains how the success of integrating Gen AI into a cybersecurity strategy hinges on two things. First, the organization’s ability to envision a collaborative intelligence partnership between humans and machines. Second, its adeptness in asking the right questions. Establishing trust in Gen AI’s impact involves thoroughly understanding its capabilities and recognizing its power and potential to drive transformative outcomes.\nClick here to explore the guide and learn how Gen AI can assist in transforming your organization’s cybersecurity posture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Thanks for your feedback\n\n              If you would like to help improve Deloitte.com further, please complete a 3-minute survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour feedback is important to us\n\n            To tell us what you think, please update your settings to accept analytics and performance cookies.\n          \n\n\n\n\n                  Update analytics and performance\n               \n\n\n\n\n Need help updating cookies? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiels van de Vorle\n\nPartner I Risk Advisory\n\nnvandevorle@deloitte.nl \n\n\n+31882882186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Morris\n\nStrategy and Innovation Leader\n\nmicmorris@deloitte.com \n\n\n+1 303 312 4773\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n/\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the latest insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedefining Third Party Management with Gen AI\n\n\n\n\n                Explore how the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and recent developments in generative (Gen) AI can create significant opportunities for competitive advantage through efficient and effective management of third parties within organizations ecosystems.\n              \n\n\n\nPerspective\n\n\n                  7 minute read\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Trust Maturity Survey\n\n\n\n\n                Learn more about how leading organizations are taking proactive measures to enhance integrity and boost confidence across their digital and business landscapes.\n              \n\n\n\nPerspective\n\n\n                  5 minute read\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity threats and incidents differ by region\n\n\n\n\n                Learn more about how 20 countries and three global regions compare across key cyber threat considerations.\n              \n\n\n\nPerspective\n\n\n                  5 minute read\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey\n\n\n\n\n                Find out how leaders across industries are building long-term value by putting cyber at the heart of the business.
