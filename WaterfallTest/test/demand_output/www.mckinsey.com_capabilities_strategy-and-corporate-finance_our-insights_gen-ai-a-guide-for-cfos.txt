Now, generative AI (gen AI) is beginning to show its disruptive potential (see sidebar “Gen AI: A primer”). The technology won’t affect all businesses equally, and certainly not at the same time. Yet across industries and geographies, gen AI could present substantial opportunities for significant value creation.\nShare SidebarGen AI: A primerGenerative AI (gen AI) is a predictive language model that produces new unstructured content such as text, images, and audio. Traditional, or analytical, AI, by contrast, is used to solve analytical tasks such as classifying, predicting, clustering, analyzing, and presenting structured data.\nGen AI technology is powered by artificial intelligence models called foundation models, which are trained on a broad set\nof data, including the outputs from analytical AI. It can be adapted to generate (hence the name) content that seems human, such as written documents, audio conversations, software programming, charts, and visual images. But it doesn’t create the way a human does: it predicts what a human would enjoy or find useful. And unlike traditional, analytical AI, gen AI doesn’t calculate or do math. The technology, therefore, won’t displace traditional AI. Instead, the ideal is that each will complement and enable the other, with new innovations in robotics and automation, to make human lives better, more creative, and more self-fulfilling.\nFor more about gen AI, see “The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year,” “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” “The organization of the future: Enabled by gen AI, driven by people,” and visit our featured insights page “Insights on Artificial Intelligence,” all on McKinsey.com.\nBut value doesn’t create itself. Instead, it’s the CFO’s role to allocate resources at the enterprise level—rapidly, boldly, and disproportionately—to the projects that create the most value, regardless of whether they are driven by gen AI. Similarly, in leading the finance function, the CFO can’t implement gen AI for everyone, everywhere, all at once. CFOs should select a very small number of use cases that could have the most meaningful impact for the function. In this article, we’ll discuss how CFOs can most effectively approach gen AI company-wide, prioritize specific use cases within the finance function, and rapidly climb the gen AI learning curve.\nGen AI and enterprise-level value creation\nMost Popular InsightsMcKinsey technology trends outlook 2024What to read next: McKinsey’s 2024 annual book recommendationsThe loneliest job?

Gen AI holds the potential to be a revolutionary technology, but it doesn’t change foundational principles of finance and economics: a company must generate a return above its cost of capital.\nMoreover, company capital (or access to more capital) is finite, and projects compete with one another. For CFOs to maximize value creation, they must rank the company’s 20 to 30 most value-accretive projects regardless of whether they are AI-related. The Pareto principle always applies; usually a very small number of opportunities will deliver most of the company’s cash flows over the next decade. The CFO cannot let the highest-value initiatives wither on the vine merely because a competing project has “gen AI” attached to it. Sooner or later, shareholders have to pay for everything, and none of them should be on the hook for a gen AI premium.\nBut to that same point of maximizing shareholder value, a CFO must recognize existential threats to a company’s businesses and be clear about the most important levers for generating and sustaining higher cash flows. When an opportunity squarely addresses or significantly relies on gen AI, CFOs should not shunt it aside because they don’t understand the technology or lack imagination to recognize the value it could create.\nOften, a choice about capital allocation won’t be either/or: an important business or value lever\ncan have an even greater impact by incorporating gen AI. That applies whether the most important drivers are revenue generators (such as creating an interface that will attract more customers or encourage more cross-selling), margin expanders (for example, reducing manufacturing, procurement, or distribution costs), or a factor that spans revenues and costs (such as helping to attract, retain, and motivate employees by freeing them for more creative work).\nMicrosoft, for example, has been far ahead of the curve in investing in gen AI to build competitive advantage in key core businesses, such as by creating the Microsoft 365 tool Copilot, which provides real-time suggestions to improve documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. While demonstrated commercial success has largely come from digital natives, some traditional, nontechnology companies are moving aggressively as well. Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management division, for one, has shown remarkable progress in developing an internal-facing service that uses OpenAI technology and Morgan Stanley’s proprietary data to provide its financial advisers with relevant content and insights in seconds.\nShare SidebarNew technology, new risksThe CFO is often a company’s de facto chief risk officer, and even when a company already has a separate risk team (as is the case, for example, with financial institutions), CFOs remain a key partner in helping to identify and mitigate risks.\nGenerative AI (gen AI) brings a slew of them. In fact, the old phrase that “to err is human; to really foul things up requires a computer” applies now more than ever. To start with, even the most cutting-edge gen AI tools can make egregious mistakes. Since gen AI can’t do math and can’t “create” out of thin air—instead, it’s constantly solving for a what a human would want—it can “hallucinate,” presenting what seems to be a convincing output but what is actually a nonsense result. Such was the case, for example, when one leading gen AI platform wrote what appeared to be a convincing legal brief—except that its citations were fantasy, including court cases and quotations supposedly made by judges but in fact conjured by the model.1Dan Mangan, “Judge sanctions lawyers for brief written by AI with fake citations,” CNBC, June 22, 2023. Gen AI models can also produce wildly incorrect financial reports; the product appears flawless, but the line items don’t apply to the company and the math looks like it should sum but doesn’t. What seems like a real 10-K form on the first flip through may be wholly untethered from reality.\nBeyond hallucinations, other important concerns include legal issues stemming from the intellectual property used as the source of gen AI models, not just in terms of the rights to present the information\nbut also to process the information to teach the solution as it learns. (This is a major reason why gen AI can be particularly applicable for the finance function for internal use cases—company data is often proprietary.) Other risks include privacy breaches, such as exposing confidential or even market-moving information to third-party models, model bias, and tail event errors that could result from an absence of having a human being stress test what the solution creates.2See Roger Burkhardt, Nicolas Hohn, and Chris Wigley, “Leading your organization to responsible A.I.,” McKinsey, May 2, 2019; and Benjamin Cheatham, Kia Javanmardian, and Hamid Samandari, “Confronting the risks of artificial intelligence,” McKinsey Quarterly, April 26, 2019. An overreliance on gen AI and lack of understanding underlying analyses or data can also reduce the preparedness of finance teams to gut check “reasonable­ness” of outputs. It’s critical to bear in mind that gen AI is designed to enhance the productivity of people, not to replace them. While it can boost efficiency tremendously, real people must always be involved.\nA world-class CFO ensures that these and other gen AI initiatives aren’t starved of capital. Indeed, one of the biggest misconceptions we find is the belief that it’s the job of the CFO to wait and see—or, worse, be the organization’s naysayer. Capital shouldn’t sit; it should be aggressively moved to fund profitable growth. The best CFOs are at the vanguard of innovation, constantly learning more about new technologies and ensuring that businesses are prepared as applications rapidly evolve. Of course, that doesn’t mean CFOs should throw caution to the wind. Instead, they should relentlessly seek information about opportunities and threats, and as they allocate resources, they should continually work with senior colleagues to clarify the risk appetite across the organization and establish clear risk guardrails for using gen AI well ahead of the test-and-learn stage of a project (see sidebar “New technology, new risks”).\nThe best CFOs are at the vanguard of innovation, constantly learning more about new technologies and ensuring that businesses are prepared as applications rapidly evolve.\nFor some CFOs, it may feel orthogonal as a “numbers person” to champion visionary innovation. But they’ve got to do it: market-beating growth won’t come from incremental change. Behind the scenes, CFOs can take advantage of their relationships with functional and business unit leaders to prod them about exploring gen AI opportunities, and repeatedly follow up in subsequent interactions. They should upskill and empower their own team members to build important relationships across the organization and better understand the assumptions underpinning innovation projects. And they should be “always on” when it comes to innovation—not just in periodic reviews or when closer scrutiny is needed for struggling projects.\nGen AI and the finance function\nFor many finance functions, gen AI will be table stakes—one among several of the essential tools that every effective, forward-looking finance function will use. The technology has the potential to save meaningful amounts of time and resources. That in itself is a reason to move forward—and\nwhy most, if not all, finance functions in large enterprises will likely be using gen AI in significant ways within the next three to five years. In fact, one way to conceptualize gen AI is to consider it as digital’s “third wave” (Exhibit 1). The first wave is to establish a digital foundation; in our biennial survey of global CFOs completed in late 2023, about two-thirds of respondents reported that their functions were digitally connected and using data for the basics such as visualization in dashboards.1See “CFOs’ balancing act: Juggling priorities to build resilience,” McKinsey, August 31, 2023.\nExhibit 1We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nThe second wave, clearly under way, is analytics empowerment; about half of the CFOs reported that their functions were already using advanced analytics for discrete use cases such as cost analysis, budgeting, and predictive modeling. The third wave will make extensive use of robotics and AI. Very few companies are at the third wave yet. But bold CFOs put their finance team in the best position to learn to work with these tools as the technology gains momentum.\nGetting started in the finance function\nCFOs typically aren’t software engineers, let alone practiced experts in predictive language models. But they don’t have to be. Their first step should be to try out the technology to get a feel for what it can do—and where its limits are at the moment. Solutions such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT are available online, and other applications (including McKinsey’s Lilli) are already in use.\nCFOs’ first step should be to try out the technology to get a feel for what it can do—and where its limits are at the moment.\nTry experimenting by uploading publicly available earnings calls transcripts from your competitors and asking the AI tool to produce the five most-asked questions—and to suggest answers. Or upload your company’s and its competitors’ financials, and ask the gen AI solution to take the perspective of an activist investor: What elements of your company’s performance would an activist home in on? Depending upon the sophistication of the gen AI solution, CFOs can also upload invoice and payments data and ask it to create charts that visualize the information—including a request for the one, most important chart. We find that when CFOs experience the technology firsthand, they not only better understand what gen AI is but also more rapidly grasp near- and immediate-term opportunities.\nWe advise CFOs to budget a nominal amount at the learning stage, not for purposes of deploying AI at scale but rather to improve the learning experience for themselves and their team members. Again, though, the goal is not to let a thousand flowers bloom. Instead, CFOs should select a handful of use cases—ideally two to three—that could have the greatest impact on their function, focus more on effectiveness than efficiency alone, and get going.\nOne point that quickly becomes apparent when moving forward is that gen AI is not plug and play; companies can’t simply set the models on existing sources of information and let them have at it.\nGen AI doesn’t create like a human does or have a eureka moment. It doesn’t even do math (that’s\nthe remit of traditional, or analytical, AI). Gen AI is a predictive language model—a translator that\nsits above existing unstructured data and seeks to generate content that a human would find pleasing. The data sets themselves first need to be rigorously processed and curated, just as data scientists prepare data lakes for advanced analytics and analytical AI.\nIdentifying use cases\nWe believe that gen AI can have an impact on finance functions in three major ways. First, through automation—performing tedious tasks (such as creating first drafts of presentations). Second, by augmentation—enhancing human productivity to do work more efficiently (such as by gathering and synthesizing multiple pieces of information into a coherent narrative). Third, through acceleration—extracting and indexing knowledge\nto shorten financial reporting cycles, and speeding up innovation. Gen AI can greatly enhance CFOs’ ability to manage performance proactively and support business decisions. A high-performing finance function understands the use cases that could most significantly and feasibly improve their function (Exhibit 2).\nExhibit 2We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

For example, solutions exist that provide a general Q&A chatbot, a chart creation tool that generates charts seconds after receiving a prompt or description of code, and a visualization tool that customizes charts by using existing code and validating the accuracy of the code.\nDigital performance management, which answers performance-related questions, synthesizes status and scenarios, identifies drivers and root causes of budget variances, and suggests resolutions. This solution is typically self-serve, business user–friendly (as opposed to finance user–friendly), and can lead to more effective performance management dialogues.\nFirst drafts of external reporting, which not only can save weeks of team time in preparing advanced first drafts of securities filings and stakeholder reports (such as sustainability reports) but also runs queries on the current regulations and standards to help ensure that the reports meet current standards.\nWorking capital management with features such as an always-on support bot to help facilitate collections and payments, and an always-updated customer payment history risk assessment, including the capability\n    to limit customer credit based on real-time information about customer-specific activity and market events.\n\nThe array of gen AI use cases is wide, varied—and no longer merely theoretical. And while it’s still early days, the rate of adoption is speeding up. Those realities make it even more important for CFOs to get started in a considered and proactive way.\n\nGen AI can be an important tool for value creation. CFOs should strive to be gen AI enablers, not gatekeepers, and make sure that strategically critical initiatives rapidly and continually receive necessary resources. They should also ensure that they and their own function quickly climb the gen AI learning curve.
