"New research from McKinsey shows that generative AI technologies could increase corporate profits by $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually. Sectors such as banking, high tech, and life sciences are expected to benefit the most. Generative AI has the potential to automate work activities and boost labor productivity by 0.1% to 0.6% annually. Workforce transformation is likely, with up to half of today's work activities potentially being automated between 2030 and 2060. However, employees will require support in learning new skills to work alongside generative AI."
