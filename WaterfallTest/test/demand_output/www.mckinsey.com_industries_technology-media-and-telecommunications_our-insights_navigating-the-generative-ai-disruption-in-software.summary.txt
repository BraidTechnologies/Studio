"The adoption of Gen AI in the enterprise software sector is increasing rapidly, with significant spending predicted. This will disrupt user segments and industry dynamics, creating opportunities and challenges. Gen AI is expected to represent 15% of total spending by 2027, with key areas of adoption in marketing, sales, legal, auditing, and HR. Software leaders need to innovate and leverage proprietary data to stay competitive. Gen AI will impact software categories and increase competition among vendors, affecting functions like sales, marketing, finance, and customer service. The adoption of AI in software development can lead to faster onboarding and replication at a lower cost, eroding advantages enjoyed by industry incumbents. The shift towards Gen AI may reallocate software spending from buying to building in-house, particularly with the rise of citizen developers. Various software categories will be disrupted and re-imagined, driven by automation and increased semi-expert users. Software leaders need to assess if they are moving fast enough and reallocating resources strategically."
