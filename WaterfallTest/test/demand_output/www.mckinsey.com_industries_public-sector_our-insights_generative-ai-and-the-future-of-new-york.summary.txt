"Gen AI, or generative artificial intelligence, will impact jobs in the New York region. It may lead to job losses in office support, customer service, and food service, while creating new opportunities in healthcare and engineering. Collaboration between sectors is needed to lessen the negative impact and provide training for workers. Despite potential job losses, there will be net job growth due to factors like infrastructure investment and shifts to e-commerce and remote work. New York State is leading in this area with initiatives and legislative protections."
