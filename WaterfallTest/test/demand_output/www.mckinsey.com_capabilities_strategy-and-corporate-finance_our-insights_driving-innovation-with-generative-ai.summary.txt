"Companies that embrace innovation are leading in the use of generative AI. Top innovators use gen AI to drive growth by adopting new processes, models, and customer experiences. They invest in R&D and digital technology, focusing on differentiation and deploying generative AI. Implementing gen AI involves asking good questions, challenging assumptions, and automating workflows. Companies can learn from leaders in the field and apply gen AI across various sectors. While regulations are introduced, companies can still use gen AI with guidelines. Understanding gen AI limitations and building contextual questions are important for valuable insights. Cross-functional teams, control functions, and feedback loops mitigate risks. Companies should start investment in proprietary data for gen AI with low data load use cases. Diverse skills and tech-savvy leaders drive innovation. CEOs should understand and adapt to this technology."
