"A McKinsey report predicts that generative AI could automate 30% of US working hours by 2030, but it will mostly enhance the work of STEM, creative, and business professionals rather than replacing them. Office support and customer service jobs are most likely to be affected. Climate and infrastructure investments may shift demand towards higher-wage jobs. Adaptation will require workforce development and inclusive hiring practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated remote work and automation adoption. Generative AI offers automation opportunities across industries. The future job market will see 12 million occupational shifts, with growth in business, legal, management, healthcare, transportation, and STEM professions. Education and construction industries are expected to recover. Training and re-skilling are important to address workforce mismatches. Labor market challenges include shortages, high quit rates, and an aging population. Partnerships and incentives are needed for successful re-skilling."
