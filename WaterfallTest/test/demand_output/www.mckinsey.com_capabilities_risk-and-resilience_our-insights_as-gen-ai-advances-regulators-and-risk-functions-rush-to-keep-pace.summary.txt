"Regulators and risk functions are struggling to keep up with the rapid advancement of generative AI technology. The lack of regulation and fragmented approaches pose challenges for organizations. Countries around the world are taking different approaches to AI regulation, with a focus on transparency, human oversight, and accountability. Organizations need to adhere to principles such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and environmental impact to avoid legal and reputational risks. Transparency, governance, data management, model management, cybersecurity, and individual rights are crucial in the development and use of AI. Failure to handle AI responsibly can lead to damages and organizations should focus on these measures to establish trust."
