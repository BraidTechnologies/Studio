A May 2023 survey of around 75 CFOs at large organizations found that almost a quarter (22 percent) were actively investigating uses for gen AI within finance, while another 4 percent were pursuing pilots of the technology.\n SidebarAbout the authorsThis article is a collaborative effort by Steve Eklund, Lisa Kaufman, Avani Kaushik, Andrii Kurdiuk, Jan Svoboda, and Edward Woodcock, representing views from McKinsey’s Operations Practice.\nThat enthusiasm has been tempered by concerns over safety, privacy, accuracy, copyright, and social manipulation. In the case of finance, where numerical data and the accuracy of mathematical operations are fundamental, there is also concern over the possibility that gen AI systems could produce inaccurate or misleading information, a phenomenon known as “hallucination.”\nTo capture the benefits of these exciting new technologies while controlling the risks, companies must invest in their software development and data science capabilities. And they will need to build robust frameworks to manage data quality and model engineering, human–machine interaction, and ethics. Case examples in this article show how these technologies can accelerate and enable access to critical business information, giving human decision makers the information to make thoughtful and timely choices.\nTo read the full article, download the PDF here.About the author(s)Steven Eklund is a partner in McKinsey’s Stamford office, where Edward Woodcock is a senior expert; Lisa Kaufman is a specialist in the London office; Avani Kaushik is an expert in the Southern California office; and Andrii Kurdiuk is a senior data scientist in the London office, where Jan Svoboda is an associate partner.Talk to usExplore a career with usSearch OpeningsRelated ArticlesMcKinsey DirectHow finance skills are evolving in the era of artificial intelligencePodcastReset and reimagine: The role of generative AI in SG&A successSign up for our Monthly Highlights newsletterDon't miss this roundup of our newest and most distinctive insightsSubscribeSign up for our Monthly Highlights newsletterWe use cookies to give you the best possible experience with mckinsey.com.
