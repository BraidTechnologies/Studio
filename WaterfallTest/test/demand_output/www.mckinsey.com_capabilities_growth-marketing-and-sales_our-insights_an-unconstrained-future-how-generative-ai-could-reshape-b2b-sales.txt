The fundamental expectations of a seller’s role—building trust-based relationships, finding opportunities to create value for customers, and creating experiences that minimize friction—have remained constant over time. What’s new are the tools available to help sellers become more productive, especially with the rapid emergence of generative AI (gen AI) in recent years.\nMost Popular InsightsThe ten rules of growthWhat is Gen Z?Six strategies for growth outperformanceMost Popular InsightsThe ten rules of growthWhat is Gen Z?Six strategies for growth outperformanceMcKinsey technology trends outlook 2024The Journey of Leadership: How CEOs Learn to Lead From the Inside Out\nBecause of gen AI’s great promise, companies at all stages of technological development have been exploring its implications for their businesses. Those in B2B sales are reporting strong business outcomes and real impact from their initial gen AI builds, and they have told us that they’re eager to do more. At this point, it appears that the widescale adoption of gen AI isn’t just probable but inevitable.\nExperimentation and development with gen AI is still playing out. In this article, we look at how technological changes are currently impacting B2B sellers. Then we explore three pathways for how B2B sales could evolve over the next decade: fundamental reimagination of sales efficiency, meaningful sales growth, and reframing of the sales operating model. On each pathway, gen AI’s role progressively deepens. Finally, we describe how companies can take steps now to prepare for a gen-AI-enabled future of sales—one with a journey powered by gen AI so ubiquitous that it’s nearly undetectable.\nHow new technology is rewriting the rules of sales\nIn the past decade, automation, data analytics, and machine learning solutions have helped B2B sellers become more effective. Companies that have empowered their sales teams through technology, including automation, now report consistent efficiency upticks of 10 to 15 percent.1“Sales automation: The key to boosting revenue and reducing costs,” McKinsey, May 13, 2020. They also report an increase in the amount of time that sellers spend in front of customers and a decrease in the time spent performing back-office activities, such as pipeline management and invoicing (see sidebar “In the field: A customer experience success story”).\nGen AI offers the promise of even greater productivity and growth. In previous research, McKinsey estimated that gen AI could open up an incremental $0.8 trillion to $1.2 trillion in productivity across sales and marketing, on top of the productivity increases already realized from traditional analytics and AI applications.2“The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey Digital, June 14, 2023. It’s not surprising that the function that saw the greatest jump in adoption of gen AI applications from 2023 to 2024 is sales and marketing.3“The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value,” QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, May 30, 2024.\nAccording to the most recent McKinsey B2B Pulse Survey, B2B sellers are in the early stages of using gen AI.4Candace Lun Plotkin, Jennifer Stanley, Liz Harrison, and Víctor García de la Torre, “Five fundamental truths: How B2B winners keep growing,” McKinsey, September 12, 2024. Just 21 percent of surveyed commercial leaders (defined as top management, sales leaders, and marketing leaders) report that their companies have fully enabled enterprise-wide adoption of gen AI in B2B buying and selling, and 22 percent have only piloted specific use cases (Exhibit 1).\nExhibit 1We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

More than 85 percent of surveyed commercial leaders who have deployed gen AI in their organizations report that they’re “very excited” about the technology.5Candace Lun Plotkin, Jennifer Stanley, Liz Harrison, and Víctor García de la Torre, “Five fundamental truths: How B2B winners keep growing,” McKinsey, September 12, 2024. They point to improved efficiency, top-line growth, and customer experience as among the most important benefits that gen AI could have for B2B selling (Exhibit 2).\nExhibit 2We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

We believe that the question of widespread adoption of gen AI isn’t a matter of “if” but rather “when” and “how.”\nIn the field: A customer experience success storyA large European telco on a mission to increase customer satisfaction and sales performance decided to see whether use of generative AI (gen AI) could identify new service-based opportunities that were personalized and adaptive. It developed a gen-AI-powered dashboard for call center managers and sellers that analyzed customer service call scripts, scored conversation performance, identified skill improvement opportunities, and created dedicated coaching programs for sellers. This use of gen AI has led the telco to a 20 to 30 percent improvement in customer satisfaction.\nThe next frontier for gen AI in B2B sales\nShare SidebarAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinseyQuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world’s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nAs companies step up their investments in gen AI, we wanted to explore what the next decade might look like for B2B sales. We asked dozens of cross-functional design thinkers, sales executives, and frontline sellers across multiple industries how they envisioned a gen- AI-enabled future. We also discussed the foundational ways in which gen AI could change the way that sellers sell.\nBased on these discussions, we mapped out the three previously mentioned possible pathways in which gen AI could transform the future of B2B sales. On the first pathway, gen AI improves productivity by assisting in task automation, taking friction out of today’s sales process. On the second one, gen AI helps identify new pockets of growth. And on the third, embedded gen AI is at the core of B2B sales that have changed fundamentally. These tracks are neither parallel nor discrete: the future of gen-AI-enabled B2B sales could be a combination of all three.\nPathway one: Shifting the efficiency frontier\nIn the first forward-looking pathway, gen AI increasingly augments sales capabilities across a breadth of activities, freeing salespeople’s bandwidth so that they can spend higher-quality time with customers (see sidebar “Imagine this: How generative AI can help sellers be more productive”). Gen AI is poised to transform productivity in several key ways:\n\nResources will be allocated more effectively. Powered by analytics and forecasting, the integration of gen AI with advanced machine learning techniques can increase the precision with which companies anticipate future customer demand. Sellers can better allocate resources to the opportunities with the highest ROI. The integration can also have downstream impact on operational capabilities (such as inventory management, product development, and supply chain).\nThe contextual expertise required of sellers will be reduced. Today, sellers need to invest extensive time in developing deep industry knowledge and product expertise. Gen AI can boost research efforts and provide critical insights in mere moments, helping sellers serve customers quickly across diverse industries, geographies, and cultures. Knowledge that used to require hours of research or even years of experience to acquire can be  obtained and at sellers’ fingertips in real time freeing them to become agile generalists.\nEmotional intelligence skills will become central. With gen AI automating most procedural or routine tasks, sellers will have more time to center on what they tell us is most important: building trust-based relationships with customers. They can focus on functions that require empathy, deep critical thinking, and complex problem-solving skills, such as serving as customer advocates, supporting clients through complex decisions, and helping customers realize value from the products or services that they’re selling.\n\nImagine this: How generative AI can help sellers be more productiveIn a world where generative AI (gen AI) handles an increasing number of operational tasks, picture “Maria,” a commercial leasing agent at a real estate company who has just finished a meeting with a company seeking new office space in New York City. Instead of Maria going back to her office to complete follow-up tasks manually, she can ask gen AI to summarize meeting notes, set up a new customer account, and schedule three showings for the company in the following week based on available inventory. Maria is now free to go to her next appointment in New Jersey and, during the ride, to have gen AI help her with research on tenancy laws in preparation for her meeting.\nPathway two: Releasing a new growth paradigm\nIn the second pathway, gen AI supercharges go-to-market teams, driving growth across existing and new customers and enabling sellers to pursue more high-potential opportunities with higher win rates (see sidebar “Imagine this: Reaching new customers through generative AI”). Gen AI can accelerate growth and reimagine the sales process in meaningful ways:\n\nSellers can engage with customers at the right moments. Gen AI can monitor organizational attributes (such as product launch timing and top-management changes) and predict individual customer needs. With scripts, nudges, and cues, gen AI can feed the ideal pitch to a seller at the right time, with limited prompting, and even get better over time.\nSellers can unlock new segments, markets, and products. Gen AI can monitor internal and external customer reactions, including online reviews and social media, to inform product development and new solutions. This can open up entirely new revenue streams. Moreover, gen AI can help sellers form a holistic view of an entire industry, from supply-and-demand insights to the competitive landscape, to help shape the way a company offers, prices, and sells products. As a shipping and logistics executive told us, “Growth will come to those who leverage the emergence of AI platforms to know their and their competitors’ capacity and truly go to market and monetize with that insight.”\nSellers can operate at peak performance. Gen AI can continually analyze seller activity, recognizing strengths and synthesizing best practices to provide constant coaching tailored to individuals’ selling styles and help them perform at their best for every sale. Gen AI can also identify the critical skills needed for sellers to excel and flag any new candidates with matching capabilities, regardless of background, helping companies hire the greatest talent.\n\nImagine this: Reaching new customers through generative AIIn a world where generative AI (gen AI) frees up time for sellers to seek new markets, picture “Pranav,” who works for a company that develops textile sensors that can be embedded into comfortable garments. His current sales accounts are mainly athletic-apparel companies, but gen AI helps him identify a new potential market: medical companies that can use the sensors to monitor and detect health issues. Gen AI develops a map for Pranav to expand his reach, detailing how he might approach new customers. Gen AI also generates a list of potential leads, prioritizing customers ready to enter the health-monitoring space. It then coaches Pranav on adjusting his sales approach according to the audience: when pitching to fitness companies, he focuses on customer testimonials; when pitching to medical companies, he focuses on data-driven insights.\nPathway three: Radically reframing the modern sales organization\nIn the third future pathway for B2B sales, gen AI becomes a central part of day-to-day sales operations and ultimately a “table stakes” technology, much like the internet and smartphones are today (see sidebar “Imagine this: When generative AI becomes a seller’s indispensable assistant”). In this world, gen AI is simply accepted as a given in how sellers operate, and those that haven’t adopted it are left behind. The role of the seller can change in a few fundamental ways:\n\nHuman touch in sales will be reserved for priority interactions. Gen AI can be equipped to handle nearly everything across the entire sales journey, from prospecting to negotiation, with minimal human intervention. Human engagement can become a premium-only offering reserved for particularly complex, solution-based deals.\nSellers will prioritize long-term customer success. With gen AI making transactional sales by a human seller obsolete, sellers can shift how they think about sales and focus on customer outcomes: they can solve for what’s best for the customer, not the seller or provider. Gen AI can help calculate customer lifetime value so that sellers are better positioned to wait and invest for longer-term gains.\nGen AI could take on the role of a sales agent on a team. A recent McKinsey article predicted that gen AI agents could eventually act as skilled virtual coworkers, planning and booking complex logistics and handling routine customer inquiries.6Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Stephen Xu, “Why agents are the next frontier of generative AI,” McKinsey Quarterly, July 24, 2024. Imagine a future regional sales manager who has a team composed of human and AI sellers collaborating and complementing one another, effectively making human sellers more successful. For example, a gen AI agent may provide subjective assessments, tailored coaching to representatives, and prompted problem solving. As a sales leader from a large chemical company told us, “Eventually, when we and our customers both have gen AI, our respective bots will be able talk among themselves, sharing facts back and forth about the product details and customer needs.”\n\nImagine this: When generative AI becomes a seller’s indispensable assistantIn a world where generative AI (gen AI) is seamlessly integrated into the entire seller journey, picture “Neil,” who works for an up-and-coming start-up for flavored sparkling water. A gen AI copilot that Neil has been working with for three months generates leads, crafts and sends outreach emails in Neil’s voice, responds to requests for proposals, and answers customer inquiries—all while staying true to Neil’s authentic style and personality. Gen AI also calculates current and potential customers’ customer lifetime value and provides strategic advice on what initial investments and concessions Neil can make to build long-term client relationships. At a gen-AI-scheduled meeting with a prospective restaurant account, Neil is there in person to provide samples and conduct a taste test, expertly recommending which flavors complement each menu item.\nHow companies can prepare for a brave, new world\nOnly time will tell what combination of these three gen-AI-enabled pathways may come to pass. In any pathway, we should assume that gen AI would become ubiquitous—and sometimes undetectable—in the life of a seller. Companies will need to adapt, no matter what scenario plays out:\n\nIt will be critical to adapt to higher expectations. Productivity gains from gen AI mean that sellers can do more and do it faster. They will therefore need to adapt to compete by reanchoring on core competitive advantages: building trusted relationships, understanding clients as true thought partners, and focusing on problem solving. Sales organizations must adapt too. They will need to depart from a traditional approach in which they motivate sellers with short-term quotas or targets. Instead, they may increasingly want to reward and compensate for team collaboration and long-term customer impact. In such a collaborative environment, lines between sales, marketing, and customer service could be further blurred.\nPower will continue to shift further from sellers to customers. As customers get accustomed to the benefits that come from gen AI—such as instant responses, 24/7 availability, and self-serve features—they may gradually come to prefer gen-AI-equipped suppliers. Gen AI may also help sellers access the same customers at a lower cost, which would substantially increase customers’ bargaining power.\nCompanies will need to be agile. Considering the pace at which gen AI has been evolving, companies need to stay nimble and future-proof their organizations, operating models, and tech infrastructures. For example, in the face of considerable new developments in sales tech, it will be critical for organizations to quickly adjust talent expectations and go-to-market strategies, revise the ways of working among sales and cross-functional teams, and build data and technical architecture so that gen AI can be deployed and scaled in an agile way for new use cases.\n\n\nSales stands on the brink of a profound transformation. The fundamental role of the seller may not change, but the power of gen AI ensures that the art of selling will look very different in the future.About the author(s)Lareina Yee is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, Richelle Deveau is a partner in the Southern California office, and Steve Reis is a senior partner in the Atlanta office.\nThe authors wish to thank Bryan Hancock, Cindy Van Horne, Dhruv Sriram, Douglas Merrill, Lars Fiedler, Lindsay Sackellares, Lisa Harkness, Melissa Dalrymple, Sonia Joseph Griffin, Vicky Chen, and Victoria Bough for their contributions to this article.\n\nThis article was edited by Christine Y.
