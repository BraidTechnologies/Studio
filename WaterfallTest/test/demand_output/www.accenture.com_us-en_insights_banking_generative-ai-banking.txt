One year later, banking has moved from the question of whether the technology will change banking to where we should start and what the ultimate impact will be.\nGenerative AI is not going to rewrite the fundamental business of banking. But it is going to change how that business gets done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22% - 30%\npotential productivity improvement for early adopters over the next three years, according to our latest financial projections\n\n\n\n\n\n600 bps\nrise in revenue growth\n\n\n\n\n\n300 bps\nincrease in return on equity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new nature of work\nAccenture’s analysis of the potential use of the technology across different banking roles suggests this is only the beginning.\nWe concluded that 73% of the time spent by US bank employees has a high potential to be impacted by generative AI—39% by automation and 34% by augmentation. Its potential reaches virtually every part of a bank, from the C-suite to the front lines of service and in every part of the value chain. But the impact will not be uniform.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation-driven roles\n\nIn our analysis of US banks, we discovered that occupations representing 41% of banking employees are engaged in tasks with higher potential for automation. Roles such as tellers, whose jobs primarily involve collecting and processing data, would benefit greatly from automation—60% of their routine tasks could be supported by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugmentation-driven roles\n\nEmployees whose work involves a high measure of judgment, such as credit analysts, or who need to understand customers’ needs and circumstances and personalize their interactions, such as relationship managers, could be empowered by generative AI tools that help them prepare for and run meetings—34% of banking employees fall into this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-round support\n\nWe determined that 25% of all employees will be similarly impacted by both automation and augmentation. Customer service agents, who spend their time explaining products and services to customers, responding to inquiries, preparing documentation and maintaining sales and other records, are a good example. Of these tasks, 37% could be automated while 28% could be augmented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost generative AI use cases for both augmenting and automating work in banking fall into one of three categories:\nGenerative AI can be embedded within operations and existing tools and applications to supercharge employee productivity.\n\nIt can transform mid- and back-office operations by automating tedious, routine work. This will lower operating costs and free up employees for higher-value work.\n\nIt also offers new ways to innovate and differentiate. In a world of relatively homogenous digital banking experiences, it enables new ways for banks to personalize experiences, stand out in the marketplace, and boost revenue.\nDriving continuous reinvention\nThe pervasive reach of generative AI means it won’t exclusively or even primarily be a cost-saving technology, in banking its most important contribution will be to drive growth.\nThe challenge is to balance reinvention with the ongoing operation of the bank, maximizing the opportunities while limiting the disruption. To accomplish this will require not only execution excellence but also a culture of innovation, a core value of which will be curiosity.\nTremendous change at tremendous speed\nFew technologies have moved from theoretical potential to game-changing impact as quickly as generative AI. In two months, for example, ChatGPT hit 100 million active monthly users. It took Facebook about 4.5 years to reach that mark. The technology is already changing work every day for most employees at most banks.\nUnlike the digital revolution or the advent of the smartphone, banks won’t be able to cordon off generative AI’s impact on their organization in the early days of change. It touches almost every job in banking—which means that now is the time to use this powerful new tool to build new performance frontiers.\n\n\n\n\nRelated insights\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Top 10 banking trends for 2024\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Reinvention in the age of generative AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWRITTEN BY\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tKeri Smith\n\n\t\t\t\tManaging Director – Global Banking Data & Al Lead\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael Abbott\n\n\t\t\t\tSenior Managing Director – Global Banking Lead\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet there be change\n\n\n\nPreference Center\nCareers\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nLocations\nSitemap\n\n\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms & Conditions\nCookie Policy/Settings\nAccessibility Statement\nDo Not Sell/Share My Personal Information\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t© 2024\n\t\t\t\tAccenture.
