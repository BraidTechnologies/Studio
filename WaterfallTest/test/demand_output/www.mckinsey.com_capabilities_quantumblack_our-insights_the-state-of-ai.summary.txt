"Adoption of generative AI is increasing, with 65% of organizations using it in various business functions. Cost decreases and revenue increases are being experienced, especially in marketing, sales, product development, and IT. Personal use of AI is also on the rise, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Greater China. Supply chain and inventory management see the most revenue increases, while human resources benefit most from cost decreases. However, there are risks associated with AI use, and few organizations have implemented risk mitigation practices. Different approaches are used to implement generative AI, with off-the-shelf options being the most popular. High-performing organizations offer insights and are more attentive to risks. The study is conducted by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, using data weighted by global GDP contributions."
