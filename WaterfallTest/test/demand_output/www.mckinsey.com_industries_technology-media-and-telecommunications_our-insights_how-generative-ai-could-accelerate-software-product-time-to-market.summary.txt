"Generative AI has the potential to improve the productivity, quality, and experience of software product managers. A study by McKinsey showed that using gen AI tools resulted in faster time to market, improved productivity, and uplifted employee experience. Content-heavy tasks benefited the most. Product leaders should carefully select and implement gen AI tools for maximum impact. They should also prioritize customer outcomes, integrate tools, provide coaching and upskilling, implement risk controls, and reimagine the product development life cycle. This will effectively leverage gen AI's capabilities and streamline product development processes."
