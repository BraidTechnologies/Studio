"A McKinsey study found that generative AI can help software developers complete coding tasks faster. These tools automate routine tasks, suggest code, and improve documentation. However, the time saved depends on task complexity and developer experience. Generative AI should be used to augment developers, not replace them. Developers reported that it helps with code suggestions, speeding up workflow, and tackling new challenges. Human oversight is still important. Technology leaders should focus on skill development, planning for skill shifts, and risk management."
