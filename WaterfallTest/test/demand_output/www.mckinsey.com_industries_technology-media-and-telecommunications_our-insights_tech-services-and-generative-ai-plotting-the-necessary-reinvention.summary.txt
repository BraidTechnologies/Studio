"The rise of generative AI presents disruption and opportunity for the tech services sector. Providers need to transform their business models and upskill their teams to succeed in the market, which is projected to be worth over $200 billion by 2029. Traditional tech services may decline, while outsourced AI services and digital services are expected to grow. Adapting to generative AI can lead to increased revenue and profit, but there are challenges to consider such as high costs and uncertain risks. Service providers should offer AI accelerators, reassess their go-to-market approaches, develop AI talent models, establish partnerships, and create AI Centers of Excellence to drive growth in the AI services market."
