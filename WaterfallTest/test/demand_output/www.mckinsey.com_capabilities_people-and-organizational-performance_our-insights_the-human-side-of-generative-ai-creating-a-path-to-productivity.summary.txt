"The use of generative AI is increasing, but many gen AI creators and heavy users plan to leave their jobs due to a lack of flexibility and belonging. To attract and retain gen AI talent, organizations should prioritize factors like flexibility, relationships, and well-being. Gen AI can free up workers for more creative and collaborative thinking, giving companies a competitive edge. Managers should prioritize collaboration, recognize employee contributions, and engage in conversations about the changes brought by gen AI. This can lead to higher performance and loyalty."
