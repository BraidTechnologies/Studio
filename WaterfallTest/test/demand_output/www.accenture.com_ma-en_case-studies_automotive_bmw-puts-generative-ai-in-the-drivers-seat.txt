This process takes a considerable amount of time—days, weeks or even months.\nBut thanks to the power of generative AI (gen AI), we’re now able to shorten that time frame, going from data to knowledge to real-time insights in just minutes.\nThat’s what we’re doing with BMW North America, using our gen AI platform EKHO (Enterprise Knowledge Harmonizer and Orchestrator) to collect and analyze its enterprise data. The platform uses large language models to intelligently answer complex questions across business functions and use cases.\nSmart nav\nThe heart of the platform contains multiple AI-enabled applications (GPT agents) that intelligently choose the right data source and pull information based on the user’s question and enterprise-specific data.\nWhen an employee asks a question through the platform’s simple interface, it selects the right knowledge base and continues to refine answers based on the user’s feedback. EKHO solves new issues by learning from and applying past scenarios and pulling any new information added to the knowledge bases in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-40%\nproductivity surge with EKHO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGen AI: The reverb effect\nThanks to the platform’s flexibility, EKHO can be applied to a vast number of tasks across the company—and on the showroom floor.\nImagine a BMW customer walks into a dealership, ready to buy their dream car but not prepared to make lots of decisions. Between the paint, tech, interiors and accessories, there are nearly 10 million possible configurations. Each variable has its own set of rules, which means some features aren’t compatible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, a BMW salesperson would have to consult  manuals—spending hours cross-checking different features and  customizations. Using EKHO, salespeople can cut the time consuming process to a matter of minutes.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo limits, all speed\nWith its customizable architecture, EKHO use cases are virtually limitless across organizations and business functions. For example, in manufacturing, it can be used to optimize supply chain processes by answering inventory and logistics questions.\nThe EKHO platform also can be integrated with marketing and sales, providing real-time data and customer insights to optimize campaigns.\nRegardless of industry or use case complexity, EKHO’s flexible architecture and real-time analysis capabilities have the power to help companies like BMW use data and insights to stay in the fast lane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            We are making bold moves, together\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Case Study\n      \n\n         Building a streaming service with something for everyone: NBCUniversal\n      \n\n\n\n\nNBCUniversal partnered with Accenture to launch and scale Peacock, the company’s premium streaming service, that has been the fastest-growing streaming platform in the U.S. for two consecutive years.\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Case Study\n      \n\n         Turning years of data into instant insights: Fortune \n      \n\n\n\n\nAccenture and Fortune transformed the iconic Fortune 500® list into an AI-driven platform that gives business leaders access to insights like never before.\n\n\nExpand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Case Study\n      \n\n         Banking on happy customers: BBVA\n      \n\n\n\n\nBBVA worked with Accenture to become one of the world’s most customer-centric banks.
