"McKinsey has developed a generative AI platform, Lilli, to transform their operations and client services. Initially, even a basic prototype of Lilli showed potential in data analysis, planning, and problem-solving. This spurred McKinsey to integrate Lilli fully, aiming for enhanced efficiency and collaboration in an AI-first world. Lilli has been widely adopted since its launch in July 2023, with 72% of the firm using it, saving up to 30% in time on information tasks and answering over 500,000 monthly prompts. The platform has not only optimized internal workflows but also provided clients with customizable AI solutions. Ongoing enhancements are aimed at further automation and increasing user engagement. The initiative is part of McKinsey's broader AI transformation strategy, promising to reshape the firmâ€™s approach to knowledge management and client relationships."
