Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.comLearn how we built a next-gen platform to transform our client workBut why stop there? Testers of only a primitive Lilli prototype immediately leveraged it for everything from data analysis to planning and creative problem solving. This indicated that Lilli could become a platform on which we build gen AI–based applications that completely rewire the way we operate.\n“We chose to take a page out of our own book, quite literally, and approach this as part of our own Rewired transformation with clear targets,” says Rodney Zemmel, the senior partner who leads McKinsey’s technology practices, including the firm’s own AI transformation.\nSuch a transformation would enable colleagues to work more effectively and efficiently together in the emerging AI-first world and deliver the best of the firm to clients to maximize their outcomes.\n“We recognized the potential of gen AI to transform not only how we operate internally but also how we create deeper relationships with business leaders and deliver even greater value to our clients,” says Erik Roth, the senior partner who leads the firm’s development of Lilli. “However, to do it, we had to set up a new operating model that brought together parts of our firm that historically had not collaborated deeply.”20%improvement in content quality and accuracy130%time saved on information gathering and synthesis500K+prompts answered by Lilli each monthThe Impact \nMuch more than a research partnerSince Lilli’s firmwide rollout in July 2023, the platform has been widely adopted, with 72 percent of the firm active on the platform, and colleagues reporting up to 30 percent time savings in searching and synthesizing knowledge. More than 500,000 prompts every month (and growing) help colleagues around the world and across functions in numerous ways, including the following:\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

For example, colleagues and leaders now think more critically about how they create and codify knowledge, with an eye toward how it can enhance Lilli’s capabilities. And colleagues have reshaped their workflows to incorporate the power of Lilli.I’ve adopted Lilli in my day-to-day workflow. I don’t have to start from zero anymore—I can get a head start on any project I have. It has been a game changer for my career.Susan ReyesExecutive Assistant, PhoenixPerhaps more important than the benefits we’ve realized internally are those we’ve been able to share with clients. The hands-on experience we’ve gained from developing and evolving Lilli provides valuable guidance for hundreds of clients pursuing their own gen AI endeavors. And we offer them a version of the architecture underlying our gen AI platform that is customizable for their organization’s specific work and industry—a key to both platform adoption and competitive advantage.\n“Our clients are getting value from specialized knowledge agents similar to Lilli that are tuned to assist their employees with tasks specific to their workflow and industry. They appreciate learning from our experience creating agents in a scalable and responsible way that drives adoption,” says Delphine Zurkiya, the senior partner responsible for extending such solutions to our clients.\n1.

The ongoing development journey has been exciting, challenging, and filled with lessons. Following our Rewired framework has proven critical in guiding us through the process.\nOur business-led roadmap isn’t about building a tool; it’s about transforming how we manage and access knowledge and expertise, which is the foundation of our organization and competitive advantage.Rodney ZemmelSenior Partner and leader of McKinsey’s technology practices and firm’s AI transformationWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

The most anticipated new features? The addition of agents built to automate specific time-consuming tasks and expansion of Lilli’s slide-building capabilities.\nWhile adoption continues to grow, there’s more work to do to boost regular engagement with the platform. Lilli upgrades make up only a fraction of the effort to that end—providing continued education, fostering gen AI enthusiast communities, and employee skill development will continue to stand front and center to drive our transformation.\nMeanwhile, our colleagues at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, are working with clients to bring the power of Lilli to their own organizations to help them with everything from creating a request-for-proposal engine to speeding their drug development operations. These colleagues bring with them the innovations of QuantumBlack Labs, which regularly contributes its code to open source and has developed more than 25 proprietary tools and industry-specific applications to help organizations bring AI to bear at speed and scale.\nWhile the future opportunity for generative AI is still being written, Erik reflects on the journey McKinsey has taken with Lilli so far: “We have created something that I believe will change the way we serve our clients. We have the opportunity to set up our firm for success in its next century and perhaps redefine our industry.”We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.
