It’s time for retailers to stake a claim and act now to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinventing retail in the age of generative AI\nThe retail landscape is undergoing a transformative shift with the integration of generative AI. It’s creating unprecedented opportunities for enhancing customer service and boosting operational efficiency. Retail leaders are proactively increasing their investments in generative AI, recognizing its potential to revolutionize every aspect of the industry—from inventory management to customer interaction. As this technology advances, it is crucial for retailers to adapt and innovate, ensuring they harness the full potential of AI to remain competitive and meet evolving consumer expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nView transcript\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how generative AI is transforming the retail industry. Jill Standish, Accenture’s Global Retail Lead, highlights how descriptive, predictive and generative AI technologies are enhancing the consumer experience and creating operational efficiencies across the value chain. She emphasizes the role that large language models play in shopping, the importance of brand positioning and generative AI's potential to innovate product design and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75%\nof retail executives view generative AI as instrumental to their business’s revenue growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n93%\nof retail CxOs are planning to scale up their investment in AI and generative AI over the next 3–5 years—in terms of time, money, and human capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n50%\nof all working hours across retail have the potential to be impacted by generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming how consumers shop\nGenerative AI is set to redefine the shopping experience by personalizing consumer interactions and automating routine purchases. Imagine AI systems that predict a family’s needs, restock household essentials before they run out, or suggest new products tailored to personal tastes and preferences. This level of personalization not only enhances convenience, but also builds deeper consumer loyalty. Retailers like Instacart are already leveraging AI to simplify shopping, suggesting recipes and delivering the necessary ingredients directly to consumers’ doors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReshaping how people work\nThe adoption of generative AI in retail is not just transforming the consumer experience, but it’s also changing the workplace. AI tools equip retail employees with data-driven insights, enabling them to offer personalized customer service. For instance, store associates can use AI to access real-time inventory data or customer preferences, enhancing the quality of customer interactions. This shift is expected to redefine roles, requiring a focus on reskilling and continuous learning to prepare the workforce for a more technology-integrated job environment.\nReinventing how the business operates\nGenerative AI—coupled with classic AI and machine learning (ML)—is advancing retail operations by streamlining both back-office and customer-facing processes. AI-driven analytics help with forecasting demand more accurately, optimizing inventory levels and managing supply chains more efficiently. This leads to reduced operational costs and improved customer satisfaction. Retailers are also using AI to enhance decision-making processes, ensuring they can respond more swiftly to market changes and consumer needs, thereby maintaining a competitive edge in the fast-paced retail sector.\n\n\n\n\nThe five imperatives\nTo fully seize the generative AI opportunity, retail leaders must address these five imperatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead with value in retail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShift the focus from siloed use cases to prioritizing business capabilities across the entire retail value chain, based on an objective assessment of the business case, enterprise readiness and the corresponding return on investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand and develop an AI-enabled, secure digital core:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in technology that runs seamlessly and allows for continuous creation of new capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinvent talent and ways of working\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet and guide a vision for how to reinvent work, reshape the workforce and prepare workers for a generative AI world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the gap on responsible AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign, deploy and use AI to drive value while mitigating risks for all retail stakeholders, from consumers to suppliers and workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive continuous reinvention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause change is constant, reinvention never ends. Make the ability to change a core competency and part of company culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time to act is now\nThe opportunities for generative AI to transform the retail industry are endless. It holds the potential to deliver greater value to customers, workers and the business by meeting the five imperatives above. As we look ahead, your company can fade, follow or lead.
