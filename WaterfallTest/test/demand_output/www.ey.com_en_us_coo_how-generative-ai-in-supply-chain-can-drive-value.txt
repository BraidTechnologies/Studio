Chain Emerging Technology Leader\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCorporations have been increasingly relying on artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain for demand planning and procurement, while exploring its use in other areas, such as standardizing processes and optimizing last-mile delivery. Even amid the global pandemic, enterprises were focused on evolving their AI supply chain pilots into operationalization. But, suddenly, another evolution of AI seized the spotlight — generative AI, popularized by ChatGPT — and upended our notions of what’s possible.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How EY can help\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Supply Chain & Operations Consulting Services\n              \n\n\nDiscover how EY's supply chain team can help your business redefine its end-to-end supply chain and operations to support your enterprise objectives.\n\n            Read more\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is generative AI in supply chain?\n \nGenerative AI creates new content, such as images, text, audio or video, based on data it has been trained on. While the technology isn’t new, recent advances make it simpler to use and realize value from. As investors pour cash into the technology, executives are racing to determine the implications on operations, business models and to exploit the upside. For those who diligently pursue innovation guided by strategy and an understanding of the limitations — not by an impulse to chase after the latest shiny object — generative AI can prove to be an agile co-advisor and multiplier in strengthening supply chains.\n \nWhat once seemed like science fiction even a year ago is now being discussed as possibilities and already being leveraged in real-world use cases across the end-to-end supply chain. These projects are enabled through generative AI’s ability to:\nClassify and categorize information based on visual or textual dataQuickly analyze and modify strategies, plans and resource allocations based on real-time dataAutomatically generate content in various forms that enables faster response timesSummarize large volumes of data, extracting key insights and trendsAssist in retrieving relevant information quickly and providing instant responses by voice or text\nPlan\n \nGenerative AI adds simplicity to interactions throughout tech-enabled planning efforts. The “chat” function of one of these generative AI tools is helping a biotech company ask questions that help it with demand forecasting. For example, the company can run what-if scenarios on getting specific chemicals for its products and what might happen if certain global shocks or other events occur that change or disrupt daily operations. Today’s generative AI tools can even suggest several courses of action if things go awry. Risk management may be the most promising area, particularly in preparing for risks that supply chain planners haven’t considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand forecasting\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany organizations are using AI to analyze large historical sales data sets, market trends and other variables to create real-time demand models. ​With generative AI, optimal inventory levels, production schedules and distribution plans can be created to meet the customer demand efficiently.​\n\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction planning\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI helps with plan production and scheduling by considering factors such as customer changes, production capacities, resource availability and order priorities.​ Similar to its demand forecasting capabilities, generative AI can make production plans, schedule sequences and allocate resources effectively to minimize bottlenecks and optimize production efficiency.​\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk management\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, AI can be harnessed to analyze historical data, market conditions, weather patterns and geopolitical events, among other data sources, to identify potential supply chain risks. But instead of prepopulated dashboards, for example, generative AI can be prompted to produce risk assessments, scenario simulations and mitigation strategies on demand to help planners manage and mitigate the risks proactively.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\nOne leading US retailer built bots using generative AI to negotiate cost and purchasing terms with vendors in a shorter time frame, noting that this early effort has already reduced costs by bringing structure to complex tender processes. The technology presents the opportunity to do more with less, and when vendors were asked how the bot performed, over 65% preferred negotiating with it instead of with a human at the company. We have also seen instances where companies are using generative AI tools to negotiate against each other!\nBeyond negotiations, generative AI presents an opportunity to improve supplier relationships and management, with recommendations on what to do next. These tools are useful to quickly extract information from large contracts and help you better prepare for renewal discussions, for example.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplier management\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage natural language processing to gain insights from supplier communications and data points.

Companies are training models on their own data sets, and then asking AI to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency. Predictive maintenance is another area where generative AI can help determine the specific machines or lines that are most likely to fail in the next few hours or days. This can help improve the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) — one of the most important manufacturing metrics.\nFor instance, one leading industrial manufacturing company in Europe partnered with a tech leader to use generative AI for factory automation and product lifecycle management, shortening the product development lifecycle and boosting efficiency with automated inspection processes.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct design\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapidly generate and evaluate hundreds of alternative designs based on predefined criteria, significantly speeding up the innovation process.

This allows manufacturers to adjust their maintenance schedules to only when it is necessary, reducing downtime and costs while also extending the life of their equipment.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial science and engineering\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI can be used to discover new materials and optimize existing ones. By processing vast amounts of data on material properties and iterating on different combinations, it can propose new materials with desired properties or suggest optimizations for existing ones. This could lead to the creation of more efficient, sustainable or durable materials in manufacturing.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove\n\nHow is generative AI used in logistics? Here is an example: One of the biggest logistics companies in the US is using a proprietary AI platform to optimize picking routes within its warehouses, boosting workforce productivity by about 30% while slashing operational costs through optimized space and materials handling. While this is not a new use for AI, the generative component offers added dimensions of customization — say, optimizing based on less fuel, or to prioritizing certain deliveries or considering many other factors in a user-friendly application. Chatting with its customized tool helped the company understand if its trade network was optimized, and it even offered suggestions for improvement.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal trade optimization\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the myriad variables, including tariffs, customs regulations, trade agreements and shipping costs, to suggest the most efficient and cost-effective trade routes and strategies. This aids companies in navigating complex international trade networks, helping ensure compliance while minimizing costs.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistics network design\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize the design of logistics networks considering factors such as warehouse locations, transport links and demand patterns to generate the most efficient configuration. This leads to reduced delivery times, lower costs and improved service levels.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast-mile dynamic route optimization\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor logistics operations, one of the major challenges is routing in real time. Generative AI can continually update and optimize delivery or pickup routes based on changing factors like traffic conditions, weather and the priority of deliveries. This leads to increased efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and improved customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet started today\n\nWhile generative AI is a powerful tool with certain limitations, it is not a strategy. Focus on the business value and define a roadmap to shape and impact the organization, guided by three steps:\nFocus on domain-wide transformation: Pinpoint high-impact use cases, envisioning a cohesive ecosystem that synergizes with traditional business models and unlocks possibilities.Coordinate organization collaboration: Discuss the implications and identify the required skills across functions, going beyond technical roles.Keep an open mind — and guard against the risks: Implement proof-of-concept pilot initiatives to learn more, drive quick wins and strive for scalable adoption.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary \nAI in supply chain management will help enterprises become more resilient, sustainable and transform cost structures. While it does have limitations, generative AI presents a multiplier in what humans and technology can achieve together in building efficient and resilient supply chains — whether in planning, sourcing, making or moving. Thanks to recent updates that make it simpler to use and more effective in realizing value, organizations are now forced to determine how these advances will impact their sector or risk disruption.\n\n\n\n    Read more\n  \n \n    Read less\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this article\n\n\n\n\n              Authors\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                       Sumit Dutta\n                    \n\n\n\n                  Principal, Supply Chain & Operations, Ernst & Young LLP\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n                       Glenn Steinberg\n                    \n\n\n\n                  EY Global Supply Chain and Operations Leader\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n      Contributors\n    \n\n\n\n          Ayoub Abielmona Ayoub Abielmona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related topics\n  \n\n\n\nConsulting\n\n\n\n\nSupply-chain\n\n\n\n\nAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy supply chains must move to technology-enabled ecosystems\n\n\n            To mitigate constant disruption, COOs are transitioning linear supply chains to a fully networked digital ecosystem.
