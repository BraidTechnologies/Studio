"The demand for generative AI is increasing, prompting the semiconductor industry to innovate. Gen AI applications have different requirements and are used in B2C and B2B scenarios. The adoption of gen AI will be influenced by factors such as chip supply and cost. Data centers and servers for gen AI applications require specific components and cooling methods. The demand for AI applications is also driving the need for more computational power and high-speed network components. However, it is uncertain if the semiconductor industry can meet this demand. Careful evaluation and investment in manufacturing capacity and servers are necessary."
