"Boards should ask four essential questions about generative AI: how to unlock its value while managing risks, potential efficiency improvements and growth opportunities, ensuring necessary expertise, and integrating it into their business. Generative AI can have a significant impact across industries, but risks such as privacy concerns and security breaches must be managed. Regulation, oversight, and a coordinated approach are important. Companies should review technology capabilities and talent needs, prioritize use cases, establish partnerships, and consider organizational culture. Boards should understand generative AI, adjust composition, provide training, and explore its potential. Innovation should be balanced with caution and awareness of risks. Board members hold responsibility for its use."
