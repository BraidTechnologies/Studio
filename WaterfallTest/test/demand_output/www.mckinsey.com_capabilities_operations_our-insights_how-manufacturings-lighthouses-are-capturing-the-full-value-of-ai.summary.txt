"Leading manufacturers are using AI to improve production processes, resulting in increased productivity, better service, and reduced defects and energy usage. Gen AI is advancing and has potential in manufacturing and supply chains. Trust in AI models is important and can be built through closed-loop feedback and phased implementation. Generative AI has shown promise in engineering design, improving productivity and automating tasks. ACG Capsules has already seen benefits from gen AI implementation, and other companies should quickly adopt AI to keep up."
