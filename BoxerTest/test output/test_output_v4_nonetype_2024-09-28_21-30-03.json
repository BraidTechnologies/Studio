        "summary": "Monitoring machine learning models involves looking at outcomes and model performance metrics. Gathering feedback from users can be done through low-friction methods like accepting changes or thumbs up/down, as well as asking for longer form feedback. Common issues with language models in production include latency, incorrect answers, and toxicity. User feedback can be used to improve prompts and fine-tune the model. A formal process for developing language models can involve test-driven development and behavior-driven development, iterating on prompts based on user feedback and interaction data.",
