        "summary": "To build an effective evaluation set for language models, there are several heuristics and techniques to consider. Firstly, adding examples that are different from the rest of the dataset and examples that users interact with differently can be valuable. Language models can also generate diverse test cases using prompts, which can help bootstrap the evaluation set. As the model is rolled out to more users, continuously adding data to the evaluation set based on user preferences and annotator feedback is important. Additionally, self-critique and adding outlier or underrepresented data can enhance the evaluation set. Test coverage, analogous to test coverage in software engineering, is another important aspect to consider. It measures how well the evaluation set covers the types of tasks users perform with the system. While there are quantitative metrics available for evaluating language models, subjective questions can be assessed by prompting another model for feedback. It is important to gather manual checks and feedback from evaluators and users to improve the evaluation process. Deployment of language models can be straightforward when using an API, but isolating the logic as a separate service may be necessary for more complex models. Techniques such as self-critique, sampling multiple outputs, and ensembling can be used to improve the quality of model outputs in production. Monitoring the model's performance and user satisfaction are crucial to ensure it is effectively solving the intended problem.",
