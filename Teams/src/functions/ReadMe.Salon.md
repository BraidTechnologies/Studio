**boxer.ts**

The code is an Azure Function written in TypeScript for a Teams App to handle HTTP requests and provide boxer information.

The boxer function is the main function that processes HTTP GET requests. It extracts the "question" query parameter from the request.

The code uses axios for making HTTP POST requests and axiosRetry for retrying requests in case of rate limits or network issues, with up to 5 retries.

The function sends a POST request to the Braid API endpoint and processes the response to extract details like id, description, URL, title, and image.

It returns a JSON response with the processed boxer information or error messages for invalid requests or server errors.

Key components:
- boxer function
- axios and axiosRetry setup
- app.http for handling "boxer" endpoint requests
