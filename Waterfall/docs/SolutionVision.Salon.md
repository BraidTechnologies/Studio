# Solution Vision : Waterfall 

## 1. Introduction

The Waterfall application is a data analysis and AI-driven pipeline designed to process web-based content, summarise it, and identify key themes using cluster analysis. 

The solution aims to:
- provide Braid leadership and other stakeholders with timely and insightful AI-generated reports derived from web data
- provide the Boxer application with a back-end database of summarised and embedded content
- provide a basis for Braid clients to use Waterfall as a template for their own applications

## 2. Vision Statement

To empower Braid Leadership with an automated system that transforms a volume of free-text data into an actionable summary. 

## 3. Target Users

The primary users of the Waterfall application include:

- **Braid Leadership**: Seeking high-level insights and summaries of key topics from free-text data.
- **Boxer Application**: Requiring a back-end data processing pipeline to create and maintain a searchable database of content.
- **Client Developers**: Who may need to build their own applications using Waterfall as a template.

## 4. Key Features and Capabilities

- **Web Scraping and Data Acquisition**: Automated downloading of web pages.
- **Text Summarisation**: Generation of concise summaries of web content using AI models.
- **Embedding Generation**: Creation of numerical representations (embeddings) of text for semantic analysis.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identification of common topics by grouping similar embeddings.
- **Report Generation**: Production of interactive reports and email summaries highlighting key clusters and themes.
- **Data Storage**: Storage of data into a document database.
- **Integration with Boxer**: Generation of back-end database for Boxer, enhancing its search capabilities.
- **Test and Evaluation**: A testing framework using Pytest ensures code quality and validates the AI functions.
- **Session Management**: Session keys provide a basic level of authentication for the API.

## 5. Strategic Goals

- **Efficiency**: Deliver timely and relevant summaries, insights, and content for Waterfall users.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure the reliability and accuracy of the analysis through effective testing and evaluation of AI models.
- **Scalability**: Develop a system that can robustly handle a large volume of input data as the needs of the company grow.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The system must be able to process and summarise a large number of web pages and YouTube transcripts (1,000s) in a reasonable time.
- **Security**: The system must protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of the process, utilizing session keys for API authentication.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure the code is easy to maintain and extend for future development.

## 7. Alignment with Braid's Strategy

The Waterfall application directly supports Braidâ€™s mission of using modern AI technology to enhance AI learning and business intelligence. By providing automated insights and supporting the Boxer application, Waterfall enables Braid to adapt to rapidly evolving information landscapes and deliver high-quality educational and decision-making tools.

## 8. Future Considerations

- **Enhanced Data Visualisation**: Explore more advanced visualisation techniques to present the clustered data in an easy-to-understand manner.
- **Integration with Other Systems**: Investigate opportunities for integrating Waterfall with other Braid systems to create a cohesive data ecosystem.
- **Improved Personalisation**: Allow users to customise reporting parameters and data collection strategies.

This solution vision should be used to guide ongoing development and enhancement of the Waterfall application to support Braid's business goals.
