It’s about having roles with more complexity and subject matter expertise and functional ownership,” Sudish Panicker, managing director and head of BNY Mellon International Operations (India), told ET.The company currently has 15,000 employees in the country. BNY Mellon has set up a fintech company within the bank, PershingX.Some of the functional areas in technology are also being done out of India for the new venture, said Nitin Chandel, head of BNY Mellon Technology, India.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesThe India centre houses both operations and technology, so a lot more end-to-end work is driven out of here, he added. Its global centre for compliance and finance are both located in the country. To meet the increased demand for talent, the Indian capability centre of the US bank is also increasing its focus on hiring freshers, both for technology and operations roles.On average, 10-15% of its new hires are from campus.While this number has traditionally been higher for the technology team, Panicker said the company would double the campus hires for the operations side this year. The New York-headquartered bank was among the early ones to set up a capability centre in India in 2004. Since then, work done from here has evolved considerably, he said.“We are doing more complex functions, more end-to-end development and are a part of large transformation initiatives across the bank,” he said.Several heads of functions are now in India, with global teams reporting to them –which would not have been possible a few years ago. The shift, he said, was in terms of how the functions that were partially being managed out of India have scaled up.“There are cutting-edge areas which even globally are new to us, like digital currencies, which has exploded in the last few years. We are doing that in India as well,” Chandel said.“We are working on emerging areas like digital currencies and are working on areas like security specialists for crypto. These are the kind of roles that we are looking for in India,” he added.Cloud has been a focus area for a few years, and the work being done in cloud solutions has trended higher in the last few years.
