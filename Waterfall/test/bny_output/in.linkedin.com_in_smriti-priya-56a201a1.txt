YouTube tutorials suggested doing these projects so you are wondering, “Why aren’t my resume getting picked after I’ve completed them?”\n\nWell think about it.\n\nAs a hiring manager, how do they know you didn’t just copy an existing notebook?\n\nYou might say, “But they can at least give me a chance to prove my skills!”\n\nAgain think from their perspectives - \n\nWhat if they do give a chance but you don’t perform up to the mark, that’s valuable time wasted. Now imagine giving that time to all candidates.\n\nTo really get noticed, work on projects that will show that you’re not just another candidate.\n\nAnd there are ways. Many ways.\n\nWe will discuss some during https://lnkd.in/gMNckgRi on 14th October, 9pm.\n\n#DataScience #DataAnalytics #HiringTips #CareerAdvice #DataJobs #Kaggle #ResumeTips #StandOut #DataProjects #JobSearch #Job\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    9\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Poulami Sarkar\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Quantized embeddings offer significant advantages for NLP models, including reduced storage requirements, faster computations, lower energy consumption, and improved model interpretability.

One critical aspect of responsible AI deployment is the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\n\n👉 Product managers should establish robust mechanisms to continuously assess the performance and impact of their AI models, ensuring they remain aligned with intended use cases and do not exhibit unintended or harmful behaviors over time.\n\n👉 Product managers must consider the potential for AI systems to amplify existing societal biases or create new forms of discrimination. Proactive measures, such as conducting bias assessments and implementing fairness-aware algorithms, are essential to mitigate these risks and promote inclusive and equitable AI solutions.\n\n👉 Transparency and accountability are also crucial pillars of responsible AI deployment. Product managers should strive to provide clear and accessible information about their AI models, including their capabilities, limitations, and decision-making processes.\n\n💡 Quick Tip: Track your model performance not only from technical point of view but also from ethical, social and regulatory implications of your AI product.\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #productmanagement #productmanager #DataScience \n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    7\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ankit Mathur\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Question : Why does an AI product manager need to monitor #AI model❓ \n\nOnce AI model is developed and deployed, the job doesnt end there. Model  encodes pattern of the data it has seen during training phase. There may be several patterns or edge cases which are not part of training data. If model encounters any such patterns in testing or production phase, it will produce results which wont make sense without giving any warning about it. \n\n👉 Data drift is a common challenge faced by AI-powered products. Over time, the distribution of input data can shift, leading to a mismatch between the model's training data and the real-world data it encounters. This can result in degraded model performance, unexpected outputs, and even complete model failure.\n\n👉 The consequences of data drift can be severe, ranging from suboptimal user experiences to regulatory compliance issues. Product managers must be vigilant in detecting and addressing these challenges to ensure the continued success of their AI-powered offerings.\n\n👉 Sudden changes in metrics can indicate input data drift. Additionally, monitoring the distribution of model outputs can reveal output drift, which may signal a need to retrain or fine-tune the model.\n\nDetecting data drift early is crucial. Product managers can leverage techniques such as A/B testing, anomaly detection, and continuous monitoring to identify and address these issues. Once detected, the product team can take appropriate actions, such as retraining the model, adjusting the data pipeline, or even considering a model architecture change.\n\n💡 Quick Tip: Integrate model monitoring into your product roadmap and allocate dedicated resources to ensure the long-term success of your AI-powered offerings. Establish a comprehensive model monitoring dashboard to gain real-time visibility into the health and performance of your AI models. \n\n#artificialintelligence #productmanagement #datascience #productmanager\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    5\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ankit Mathur\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Question : What skillset does an #AI product manager need on his team for building an AI product ❓ \n\nSuccess of any AI product lies depends largely on the team involved in building it. Crafting a successful AI-powered product requires a diverse and highly skilled team.\n\n👉 ML Expertise : First and foremost, a strong data science andML expertise is a must-have. The team should include experienced data scientists who can not only build and train robust AI models but also analyze the data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. These data scientists should possess a deep understanding of statistical analysis, algorithm development, and model optimization.\n\n👉 MLOps engineering : MLOps engineers establish the infrastructure and processes to manage the AI model lifecycle. They package, deploy, monitor, and retrain models, addressing challenges like model drift and data changes. This ensures the AI-powered features deliver consistent, reliable performance.\n\n👉 Seasoned Software Engineering : Alongside the data-centric roles, AI product team should also possess software engineering capabilities. Seasoned software architects and developers are needed to design and implement the underlying infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration of the AI components with the overall product ecosystem. Their expertise in system design, scalability, and security will be instrumental in creating a robust and reliable AI-powered solution.\n\n👉 Cloud Engineering and Architecture : Cloud engineers and architects design and deploy the cloud-based resources - storage, compute, serverless functions - that power the AI engine, ensuring scalability and reliability. They implement best practices for cloud security, data governance, and cost optimization.\n\n👉 User Experience Design : The team should also include user experience (UX) designers who can translate the AI-powered features into intuitive and engaging user interfaces. These designers should have an understanding of human-AI interaction, crafting experiences that leverage the strengths of AI while addressing the needs and expectations of the end-users. They should be skilled in user research, interaction design, and visual design.\n\n👉 Domain-Specific Expertise: To ensure the AI product addresses real-world challenges, the team should also include subject matter experts who can provide domain-specific knowledge and insights. These experts can help validate the relevance and applicability of the AI-powered solutions.\n\nBy assembling a team with this diverse set of skills, AI product managers can increase the chances of creating a successful AI-powered product that not only demonstrates the potential of AI but also delivers a compelling and impactful solution to the market.\n\n💡 Quick Tip: Regularly assess the skills and expertise of your AI product team, and be ready to adapt and expand the team as the project evolves and new challenges arise.\n#artificialintelligence #productmanagement\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    7\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          maniraj chervirala\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          🌟 I've always been fascinated by the brilliance of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a true pioneer who believed that numbers could represent patterns, relationships, and even aspects of the universe. His insights into mathematics were incredibly profound, revealing the hidden beauty and complexity within numbers.\n\nToday, as I work with large language models built on numerical foundations and transformed into vectors, I can't help but reflect on how Ramanujan was truly ahead of his time. His genius continues to inspire us in the world of data science and beyond, reminding us of the deep connections that numbers hold.\n\nRamanujan's legacy lives on, pushing us to explore the mathematical tapestry that underpins our understanding of the universe. 🌌\n#Mathematics #SrinivasaRamanujan #DataScience #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence #LargeLanguageModels #DataAnalysis #Inspiration\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    1\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                1 Comment\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Aakash Gupta\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Perhaps the most critical thing in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is the retrieval or searching strategy. Poor retrieval will lead to irrelevant documents going to the LLM leading to irrelevant generated answers or worse hallucinations. Is cosine similarity everything? Do check out below illustration which talks about four of the most common strategies for playing around with retrieval strategies in RAG systems:\n\n1. Similarity-based retrieval: This is based on embedding similarity, you can play around with different metrics like cosine, maximal margin relevance etc.\n2. Similarity with Threshold retrieval: Useful where we cap the similarity threshold and can help in removing irrelevant document but can drop recall\n3. Multi-query retrieval: Make the LLM generate variations of your query and get documents based on these multi-versions of your initial query, often useful to get more recall or coverage of documents\n4. Reranker retrieval: Use a model specialised in ranking documents based on search relevance\n\nOften you can combine some of these techniques and even use ensemble retrievers. Do explore them and go beyond just cosine similarity!\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    17\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Anjineyulu Venkatesan\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Here is my podcast show with Shivani Khandelwal and with the kittens 😅 of Jaikrishnan (Jk) and Kavitha Jaikrishnan 😅 on how AI has impacted us.

It removes the editing panel for your redaction / replacement work and instead you can just explain what you need to redact / replace in normal keywords or plain sentences in a comma separated fashion.\n\n2.  It uses LLMs in the background - you can use your own privately deployed model like llama 3 70b fine-tuned version or you can also use models like GPT-4o, Claude etc. which are commercially available. It can be configured based on your requirement.\n\n3. It uses OCR for Image / Scanned Image case, which can be configured to any Cloud Server OCRs as well as open-source OCRs.\n\n4.  Can ingest multiple images and PDFs and work sync.\n\n5.  You can run multiple iterations on the same file to make many small small changes that can be possible in the PDF.\n\nNote: The process is not fully 100% accurate but it is well in range of 85-90+\n, the accuracy can vary based on the choice of LLM model with good context length and choice of OCR as well as the quality of image. [*imp]\n\n*PDFs are quite complex for handling the formatting issues, so this tool does have limitations on what length of words can be replaced because it might lead to formatting issues in the provided PDF.\n\nThere would be HIL [human in the loop] for evaluation.\n\nYou can go through the Demo once; it has 2 parts in it - one for scanned PDF and one for text readable pdf (built using Python) 😀. \n\nRight now, it is just a Streamlit demo but parallelly in the backend work is going on...\n\nPlease DM to me Mohit Singh Pawar or Aditya Sahu for more details or clarification related to its availability.\n\nAudio credits: ElevenLabs free credits.\n\nI guess will have to upload part 1 here and part 2 in a separate post.\n\npart 2 : \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gEi-DUzb\n\n#redact #llm #replace #pdf #genai #generativeai\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    56\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                5 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pranay Tiwari\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Today I am taking a new role...\n\n\n\nas an advocate for Linear Regression.\nYes, I am representing the humble Linear Regression and requesting that it gets the respect it deserves. Many interviewers and candidates ignore LR assuming its too basic. They want to discuss GPT and agents and if time permits some non linear algo like XGB. But having strong fundamentals in Linear Regression is essential because it is the foundation upon which many advanced models have been built. The assumptions behind Linear regression  determine why you would go for a more complex non linear algorithm. Then there are concepts around why a higher R squared doesnt necessarily indicate a good fit and why a statistically significant model could still be of no practical use. These are important concepts and should be understood. \nRemember how when you wanted to understand whats inside an Intel chip and you deepdived into Microprocessors and then further into flip-flops - that made you a better engineer did it not? (hopefully it did!). \nPlease don't use \"hetroscedasticity\" just to improve your speech but understand the significance of these assumptions. Give Linear Regression its due and make LR cool again. \n\nI rest my case. \n\n#Fridayhumor\n#TGIF\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    104\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                12 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Marie Stephen Leo\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          My latest Medium post comparing SetFit, FastFit, and Semantic Router for Few-shot NLP Intent Classification has been published by Towards AI!
