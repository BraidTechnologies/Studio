Bridget completely transformed BNY from old non standard tech to modern compliant systems with proper monitoring and a team of smart leaders. She built a command center that bny still shows off to clients to impress them with the apparatus. She also brings the brightest and best who’s proven themselves to her from all her from all her years in the industry. She has a strong loyal network that will benefit WF.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1\n\n\t\t\t\t\tby\n\t\t\t\t\tBD\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n|\n\nno reactions\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPost ID: @2hca+1tLSJXPL\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare Post \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuessing Saul saved TK. She is now back to supporting Consumer Technology and Generative AI. They were clear to call that out as to not hurt Chinten’s feelings. Saul is the key root cause for TK being here and still staying here. It will be interesting to watch the “butt” kissing from TK’s directs and their 1-downs when Brigit “Bardot” gets here. I wonder if Brigit will be staying at HY where there are no meaningful tech leaders in order to stay close to Chuckles. \n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 31\n\n\t\t\t\t\tby\n\t\t\t\t\tAnonymous\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n|\n\nno reactions\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPost ID: @1fjc+1tLSJXPL\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare Post \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI, Kerrins?
