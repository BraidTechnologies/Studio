It’s crucial to design eLearning experiences that are functional and user-friendly. Focus on how it works and why you’re creating it in the first place. #takesexperience #contentknowledge #howdochildrenlearn  #notabythewayjob #highlyskilled \n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Tim Slade\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Did you see it? 👀\n\n\n\nIt's finally here! 😲\n\nAnd I've been working on this for nearly a year. 🥵\n\nOur new website for The eLearning Designer’s Academy is officially live! 🎉\n\n👉 Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ea7DzjN4\n\nOn a more serious note...\n\nAround this time last year, I started thinking about some significant updates I wanted to make to The eLearning Designer’s Academy. This included refreshing and modernizing the brand, along with refining how we define what The eLearning Designer’s Academy is and the story we tell about our purpose in the world. \n\nThe truth is, our new website is more than just a facelift—it’s an embodiment of our vibrant community and the people who make it a part of their day. And this is represented throughout the entire website, with images, stories, and examples of work from real-life community members.\n\nThere’s a lot more I want to share with you all about our new website, the inspiration behind it, and the people who helped me bring it to life. So, stay tuned! In the coming days, I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came together. \n\nIn the meantime, I invite you to visit our new website, and let me know down in the comments what you think!

I've been tinkering with these recently and was excited to showcase them to anyone willing to let me geek out for a few minutes at the Articulate stand  (—thanks again for spending your time with me, Tsemaye Michael!)\n\nI’m particularly proud of a personal project that I’ve been developing on-and-off for about a year and a half now! I've always felt frustrated that Articulate Storyline 360's freeform drag-and-drop capabilities are (quite rightly) often criticised for poor accessibility.\n\nI wanted to change that, so I kept experimenting with a hybrid approach using GSAP for plotting dynamic animation paths and JS for dynamic slide position tracking of the drag object. The demo video below showcases what I've managed to achieve, where the interaction whether via mouse click-and-drag, single mouse clicks, or keyboard-only input, integrates together seamlessly without compromising the free motion experience typical of a freeform-style slide.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack about the process, which is entirely repeatable and customisable as needed per project. I'm excited to share a detailed tutorial on the Discover eLearning website very soon, so stay tuned! 🚀\n\n#ArticulateStoryline #Storyline360 #Articulate360 #JavaScript #JS #GSAP #InteractiveDesign #Accessibility #A11ly #LT24UK\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    200\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                17 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Capytech Metaverse and E-Learning\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          10 Best Practices to Implement Rapid eLearning in Microlearning [Infographic]\n\n\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Paz Giglio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Good courses are worth sharing, and this one from John Hinchliffe definitely is. \n\nI highly recommend it to anyone interested in Instructional Design, as it offers a great number of resources to gain a deeper understanding of what this role entails.

Now, I'd like to share something that might be helpful to fellow instructional designers and e-learning developers, especially those of us with no coding background!\n\nI've recently started exploring GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and JavaScript to enhance animations in Articulate Storyline. It's opening up new possibilities for creating more dynamic e-learning content!\n🔍 What I'm learning about:\nBasic integration of GSAP with Storyline\nUsing JavaScript to add interactivity to e-learning modules\nExpanding beyond Storyline's built-in animation features\nI found a helpful YouTube crash course that's guiding me through the basics.

The tutorial involved adding emphasis animations to a storyline using data model IDs, which can be a bit cumbersome to find using the traditional inspect tools method.\n\nThis is particularly helpful when working with text elements in Storyline. Inspecting text usually requires removing a div in inspect tools, making the process even more complex and time-consuming.\n\nThat's why I decided to create a nifty workaround using accessibility tags!\nThis method is a great time-saver and eliminates the need to delve into complex inspect tools.

There was a quote on page 35  from Theodore Levitt that really resonated with me and how we work at Bloom Creative Learning. The quote was: \n\n\"Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things.\"\n\nLiggy goes on to explain that we are living in an 'ideas economy that relies on turning ideas into innovation faster than the competition.' I agree with Liggy, and the quote from Theodore Levitt, but I also believe it's worth recognising that you can't have one without the other.\n\nI don't believe in innovation for innovation's sake. Staying up to date with what learners want is important, but so is acknowledging what works for them, and often the answer to that lies in what already exists! For innovation to have impact, and be worth the work it takes, it needs to come hand-in-hand with creative thinking. \n\nWhich means asking questions! What has been done before? Why is the current solution no longer fit for purpose? What are learners missing from the current training? Only once you've investigated the landscape fully and truly understand the problem you are trying to solve, should you wack out a Miro board and start innovating or 'doing new things'.  \n\nSolutions and innovation without consideration and meaning won't last.  \n\n#Creativity #Innovation #Digitallearning #Consultancy\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    16\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                2 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Articulate Storyline: A Quick Authoring Software\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Articulate Storyline is versatile and packed with features for creating gamified eLearning courses.

As they progress, the challenge ramps up, keeping them engaged and motivated to continue.\n\n⭐ Scoring System:\nThe scoring system keeps learners motivated, encouraging them to improve and aim higher. Even in this short game, there's room to expand the complexity, letting learners collect points, compare scores, or try to beat their personal best.\n\n⌛ Time Pressure:\nAdding a time element enhances engagement, requiring learners to stay focused and juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. It’s a fun way to boost concentration!\n\nStoryline Developers – here's a challenge for you! Can you guess how we built the star-based scoring system in Storyline?

Mike Taylor's excellent content 🤘 on integrating Marketing principles into L&D has inspired me. This got me thinking: What can L&D learn from the graphic design industry?\n\nHere are some observations I believe L&D could benefit from adopting more:\n\n🔹 Visual Hierarchy\nUsing visuals strategically to prioritize information helps learners retain key concepts more effectively.\n\n🔹  Simplicity and Minimalism\nReducing unnecessary information can significantly lower cognitive load and improve learning efficiency.\n\n🔹 Focus on Solving User Problems\nOur clients aren’t concerned with the tools we use (Rise, Storyline, PPT, Camtasia, etc.); they want solutions to their problems. Let’s shift our focus from the tools to the solutions we create.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts! What topics and other industries do you think L&D could learn from? ⏩ \n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    6\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                2 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Craig Stevenson\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          🚀 Rive has the potential to lift interactions in eLearning to a new level, but where do you start with learning how to use it?\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, Rive is a design and animation tool for creating interactive assets. Let's see whats next:\n\n🎯 1. Get Rive. \nDon’t worry; the first three animations are on the house. You can find it easily with a Google search.\n\n🎓 2. Time to learn\nI taught myself to a certain point with the Rive 101 video playlist on their YouTube channel. (Full disclosure: I had some animation experience with After Effects, so some concepts were a bit easier for me to take in. Most beginners should be able to work through it). This gave me a baseline of skills, but I wanted to dive deeper and felt a structured course would benefit me, which is where Motion Design School comes in. \n\nIve been trying out the first lesson of their Rive course today (for free, no less! Just create an account, I'll pop the link in the comments), and Ive learned loads more already. Check out the video attached to this post. \n\n🎨 3. Get your creations into your eLearning\nThere’s a few ways to do that, but Ive been using Kwantic.co to build courses with my Rive animations (check out my other posts to see one in action!) \n\nYou can just drop your Rive files straight in there as an interaction, no coding is needed to make them work! (Kwantic also has 3 free projects and some cool AI tools, so give it a go!)\n\nIf you have any questions about Rive let me know, or if you have ideas about how you could use this yourself, leave it in the comments!\n\n#instructionaldesign #learninganddevelopment #elearning #digitallearning\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    87\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                5 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            Show more posts\n          \n              \n\n\n                \n            Show fewer posts\n          \n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Explore collaborative articles\n        \n\n\n        We’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.
