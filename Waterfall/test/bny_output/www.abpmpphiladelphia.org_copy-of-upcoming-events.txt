Today, our mission remains unchanged - to be a long-term strategic partner. From the way we engage our clients, to how we respond to challenges in the world's financial markets, to our approach to technology, BNY Mellon is invested in innovation - new ideas that drive change.  BNY Mellon has delivered a Digital Platform that provides Data Centre as a Service, Application Development & Data Management services and a Common Portal in a highly secure private cloud. This enables us to reduce the time to market for new products and services.\n \n* Digital Pulse is a great new technology for all transactional data. We have millions of transactions that flow through our plant, both that are automated as well that require human intervention; this will capture them all.\n \n* What Digital Pulse allows us to do is to highlight all the insufficiencies we have in every process and every business that we have and that insight will make BNY Mellon a great company to work for.\nCheryl E.
