In addition, Aon and BNY Mellon will explore opportunities to further enhance solutions in the areas of digital assets and data and analytics, as client needs continue to evolve.\nCorporations, institutional asset managers and investors alike are increasingly focused on issues related to ESG, and the impact they have on both corporate performance and sustainable investing objectives.

We are excited to collaborate with BNY Mellon to further enhance how we are helping our clients make better decisions that impact their business and society,” said Greg Case, chief executive officer of Aon.\n“We are very pleased to be working together with Aon on this initiative. This demonstrates BNY Mellon’s commitment to putting the Future FirstSM by using our global reach, influence and resources to help inform and support institutional ESG goals,” said Todd Gibbons, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon. “As one of the world’s largest asset servicers— with scale and significance at the heart of the financial system and touchpoints across the entire financial value chain— we have an exceptional view of ESG trends. This provides us with a unique vantage point to establish an ecosystem focused on ESG that offers clients innovative solutions based on market best practices.”\nThis collaboration will streamline Aon’s portfolio management and research process by enhancing net-zero reporting transparency.
