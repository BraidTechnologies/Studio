CFOs are continuing to explore use cases for generative AI to support efficiency and productivity. But financial services, in particular, is one of the world’s most heavily regulated industries, so the stakes are high when it comes to incorporating the technology—and doing so in the right way. BNY is the latest bank to forge ahead and create a unique generative AI-powered assistant.\n“How BNY’s new AI tool Eliza is minting an army of disposable assistants” is an exclusive Fortune report by my colleague Michael del Castillo. With $50 trillion worth of assets under custody or administration, BNY is one of the largest banks in the world to announce a proprietary AI. \nDel Castillo writes: “BNY’s new AI tool is named Eliza in honor of the wife of Alexander Hamilton, who founded the bank’s corporate predecessor. The physical part of Eliza’s brain consists of Nvidia microchips and cloud infrastructure powered by Microsoft’s Azure and Google Cloud. But Eliza’s mind, the way she approaches problems, is a BNY original, using OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.\n“While most open-source AIs are essentially one-size-fits-all virtual assistants, Eliza lets employees create bespoke assistants (BNY prefers the term “agent”) and fill them with proprietary data in order to take on particular tasks.” Eliza is currently being used by a quarter of the bank’s employees, which is about 14,000 people.\nYou can read the full story about how Eliza came to life here. \nCEOs in the financial services sector are increasingly embracing generative AI, according to a study by IBM released in June. More than half (57%) of banking and financial markets (BFM) CEOs surveyed said that gaining a competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.\nIBM’s findings are part of an annual global cross-industry study that surveyed more than 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries. The respondents included 297 CEOs from the BFM sector.\nBut with the implementation of a technological transformation, there’s a culture change. For that reason, 65% said success with AI will depend more on people’s adoption than the technology itself. Nonetheless, 60% said they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some employees might want, according to the study.\nAnother finding is 53% said they’re struggling to find the talent to fill key technology roles. And due to generative AI, half of the CEOs said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist this time last year. Another aspect of using generative AI is maintaining customer trust—something that will have a greater impact on success than any specific product or service, according to the CEOs.\n“Workforce needs are shifting rapidly in the financial services sector and CEOs must ensure that upskilling programs are prioritized,” Shanker Ramamurthy, a global managing partner at IBM Consulting said in a statement.\nThat’s certainly something to consider as the financial services sector plans to go all in on generative AI. \nHave a good weekend.\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThe following sections of CFO Daily were curated by Greg McKennaLeaderboardSome notable moves this week:Rachel Ruggeri, CFO of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), will serve as interim CEO until Sept. 9 when Brian Niccol, currently CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., will join the company as chair and CEO.Jack Hartung, CFO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

The firm polled 225 senior business leaders at companies with $1 billion or more in revenue, with 83% of respondents saying GenAI spending will increase over the next three years and 78% confident in the ROI of planned AI investments in that span. Just 16% of those surveyed said their workforce was highly equipped across all areas necessary for GenAI utilization, however. Sixty-nine percent said their companies are training their workforces in GenAI, while 61% said their firms are actively recruiting to support AI initiatives.“The leaders I’ve talked to say that they believe a combination of investment in AI technology and talent will pay off in terms of better performance, improved quality and enhanced customer experience and loyalty,” said Carl Carande, vice chair of advisory at KPMG.Going deeperHere are a few Fortune weekend reads: “China’s newfound taste for milk could be a $626 billion business.
