in-kind creation and redemption process for relevant exchange-traded products (ETP) in 2025 through the adoption of a web-based platform, subject to technical readiness and regulatory approval.\n\nThis platform will be integrated into the ETP creation and redemption process, connecting key ETP participants with the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts, and will help increase overall ETP market efficiency, supporting the continued growth of secondary market activity for ETPs.\n\nThis latest enhancement is part of the Group's ongoing commitment to further elevate the attractiveness and competitiveness of its international ETP ecosystem, replacing several manual, paper-based processes currently present with a goal to simplify the creation and redemption procedures of ETPs and boost market activity.\n\n#ETF #StockConnect #HKEX #HongKong #ETP\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    1\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n

Our new robotic advisory portal is designed to address this pain-point and is easily accessible via both desktop and mobile devices. Manulife’s MPF contribution members who are digitally enabled will first be invited to experience this user-friendly portal during the 4-month pilot and more members will be able to enjoy this tool in the coming phases.\"\n\n \nKevin Li, General Manager & Head of Syfe Hong Kong: “Hong Kong has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, but most people are not saving enough for their retirement. One of the barriers that HongKongers have faced is difficulty in selecting funds when they construct their MPF portfolios. The platform we developed in partnership with Manulife addresses this problem by recommending a single portfolio that may be most suited to each user’s unique situation.\"\n\n\nRebecca Lim, CFA, CEO, AutoML Capital: “At AutoML, we are enthusiastic in empowering investors in Hong Kong through digital innovation. With the ML Brain, we exemplify how continuous learning and adaptation by an AI engine can help revolutionize asset allocation strategies. We strongly believe the use of AI could help MPF members make investment decisions easier. By providing tools that demystify the complexities of financial planning, we trust we could demonstrate how technology can enrich investment strategies and foster a more informed, empowered investor community.\"\n\nManulife, AutoML Capital, Syfe\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Heng An Standard Life (Asia) Limited\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Our Chief Investment Officer Ms. 张弘Harriet Zhang brings you the market outlook for Q3 2024.\n\nHarriet:” We remain optimistic on short-term interest rates but expect continued volatility in long-term rates.
