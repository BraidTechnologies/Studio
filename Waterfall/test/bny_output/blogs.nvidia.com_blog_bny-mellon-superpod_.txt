Its AI Hub has more than 20 AI-enabled solutions in production. These solutions support predictive analytics, automation and anomaly detection, among other capabilities.\nWhile the firm recognizes that AI presents opportunities to enhance its processes to reduce risk across the organization, it is also actively working to consider and manage potential risks associated with AI through its robust risk management and governance processes.\nSome of the use cases supported by DGX SuperPOD include deposit forecasting, payment automation, predictive trade analytics and end-of-day cash balances.\nMore are coming. The company identified more than 600 opportunities in AI during a firmwide exercise last year, and dozens are already in development using such NVIDIA AI Enterprise software as NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA Base Command.\nTriton Inference Server is inference-serving software that streamlines AI inferencing or puts trained AI models to work.\nBase Command powers the DGX SuperPOD, delivering the best of NVIDIA software that enables businesses and their data scientists to accelerate AI development.\nNeMo is an end-to-end platform for developing custom generative AI, anywhere. It includes tools for training, and retrieval-augmented generation, guardrailing and toolkits, data curation tools, and pretrained models, offering enterprises an easy, cost-effective, and fast way to adopt generative AI.\nFueling Innovation Through Top Talent\nWith the new DGX SuperPOD, these tools will enable BNY Mellon to streamline and accelerate innovation within the firm and across the global financial system.\nHundreds of data scientists, solutions architects and risk, control and compliance professionals have been using the NVIDIA DGX platform, which delivers the world’s leading solutions for enterprise AI development at scale, for several years.\nBy leveraging their new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD will help the company rapidly expand its on-premises AI infrastructure.\nThe new system also underscores the company’s commitment to adopting new technologies and attracting top talent across the world to help drive its innovation agenda forward.\n\n\nCategories: Hardware | SupercomputingTags: GTC 2024 | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA NeMo | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t2025 Predictions: AI Finds a Reason to Tap Industry Data Lakes\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPeak Training: Blackwell Delivers Next-Level MLPerf Training Performance\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t‘Every Industry, Every Company, Every Country Must Produce a New Industrial Revolution,’ Says NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at AI Summit Japan\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJapan’s Market Innovators Bring Physical AI to Industries With NVIDIA AI and Omniverse\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJapan Develops Next-Generation Drug Design, Healthcare Robotics and Digital Health Platforms\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright © 2024 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Share This Facebook LinkedIn Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n NVIDIA and our partners use cookies and other tools to collect information you provide as well as your interaction with our websites for performance improvement, analytics, and to assist in our marketing efforts.
