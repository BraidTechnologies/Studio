It is the world’s largest custodian bank and securities services company, with $1.8 trillion in assets under management and $45.7 trillion in assets under custody as of 2023. It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Tags: Artificial Intelligence/AI,  Banking,  Digital,  Financial Services/Finserv,  Innovation,  Investment, Asset & Fund Management,  Wealth Management BNY Mellon,  Nvidia,  supercomputer BankingTech,  FinTech,  WealthTech News North America,  USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD NEXT\n\n\n\n\n Argentinian fintech Ualá lands $300m Series E funding round at $2.75bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n LSEG taps IDVerse for AI-powered ID verification solutions\n\n\n\n\n Metro Bank fined £16.7m by the FCA for \"financial crime failings\"\n\n\n\n\n Canadian fintech Neo Financial raises $258m in mix of equity and debt funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply \n-or-\nLog in with your FinTech Futures: Fintech news account\nAlternatively, post a comment by completing the form below:\n\nYour email address will not be published.
