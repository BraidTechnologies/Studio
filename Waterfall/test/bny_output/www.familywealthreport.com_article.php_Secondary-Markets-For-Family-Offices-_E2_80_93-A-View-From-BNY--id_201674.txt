It is\n  a sign of how private market investing is, arguably, maturing. To\n  discuss this market is Ben Funk (pictured), partner at Launchbay Capital,\n  an investment firm and secondary market data platform.\n\n\nAs ever, the usual disclaimers apply to views of external\n  contributors. The editors welcome such debate and insight; please\n  email tom.burroughes@wealthbriefing.com\n  if you wish to do so.\n\n\n  A recent survey by BNY’s wealth management business said 62 per\n  cent of US family offices made at least six direct investments in\n  a private company or private lending last year, with 71 per cent\n  planning to make the same number or more in 2024. Family offices\n  still hold one of the largest segments of the market’s capital,\n  and their numbers have tripled since 2019 resulting in total\n  assets reaching an estimated $6 trillion.\n\n\n  When paired with a recent report from Sacra showing that\n  secondary markets are set to hit a record $64 billion this year –\n  a whopping 40 per cent increase in volume from 2023 – it is clear\n  that family offices will play a key role in reshaping private\n  markets and the private equity and venture capital industry as a\n  whole. \n\n\n  Whether through direct investments or a secondary-dedicated fund,\n  family offices have more avenues for diversifying portfolios and\n  enhancing liquidity via private market transactions than ever\n  before. \n\n\nUnderstanding the private market boom\n  Prior to 2020, the market’s reliability to return on private\n  growth companies going public kept funds and the family offices\n  that contributed to them coming back year after year. However,\n  since then we’ve seen inflation rates skyrocket and initial\n  public offerings deferred past traditional timelines. And now\n  they’re often projected to take anywhere between 10 to 12\n  years or longer. The public market’s short-term shifts\n  toward dividend yielding versus growth stocks can increase\n  the drag and negatively impact the potential for liquidity and\n  ability to recycle capital. \n\n\n  But, of course, IPOs ultimately re-emerge consistently. We were\n  all on the edge of our seats to see how Reddit’s public offering\n  would hold up and they came out the other side sparking renewed\n  confidence in the time-honored strategy. But venture capital\n  funds have had to re-strategize these past few years, which\n  were spent under a lot of pressure to pay out investors. On the\n  other side of the dwindling capital flow, companies needed to\n  find a new approach to compensating employees and shareholders\n  with stakes to gain in their growth and success. \n\n\n  Thus, sites were set on secondary markets where extended and\n  recurring funding rounds would yield the capital recycling\n  needed. Companies that were staying private longer began selling\n  individual shares at discounted rates to increase liquidity on a\n  faster timeline; and the private investment industry in alignment\n  began carving out secondary growth funds with exits ranging\n  between three to five years on average and building dedicated\n  data platforms at exponential rates for enhanced\n  decision-making. \n\n\n  In the past, high ticket prices associated with venture-backed\n  investments were not financially feasible for the individual\n  entities that operate within the massive family office sector;\n  especially since those investments were historically hard to\n  access longer-term investments. Yet now, with the emergence of\n  private markets as a new “semi-liquid” class of private assets,\n  family offices can take advantage of newfound flexibility.\n  Discounted share prices, co-investment and syndication\n  opportunities allowing for lowered minimum capital requirements,\n  and the liquidity and duration of these investments are much more\n  appealing. \n\n\nPortfolio diversification through direct\n  secondary-dedicated funds\n  Direct secondary venture growth funds are smaller by nature and\n  require less money to invest in individual companies. The funds\n  that write $1 to $10 million tickets are far nimbler and more\n  profitable than their overtly bloated peers. They tend to be\n  managed directly by seasoned fund managers who professionally\n  invest their own money alongside mutually aligned investors,\n  rather than manage junior people beneath them so they can gather\n  more AuM from outsiders for management fees and status. \n\n\n  The apt quantum of capital of well-structured funds enables them\n  to be simultaneously niche and generalist allocators that capture\n  most market opportunities. They too have well-honed alignment of\n  interests with investors. This is a vital element that’s\n  especially advantageous to multi-family offices that are juggling\n  the varying priorities of entities involved. They provide\n  instructional grade services that are catered individually to\n  help meet their partners’ divergent needs. \n   \n  These actively managed secondary funds are allowing family\n  offices to further fine-tune their investment approaches, while\n  maintaining flexibility when structuring deals, allowing for\n  negotiations when it comes to aligning co-investment terms with\n  specific objectives, and providing customization options that are\n  much less attainable with larger growth vehicles. For example,\n  funds may target specific sectors, like generative AI in\n  healthcare business development, or geographies, like fintech in\n  emerging markets, and deploy capital to them for specific\n  purposes and timeframes. And then reallocate profits and\n  ultimately return them to their investors more quickly than\n  others.\n\n\nThe emergence of data-driven secondary analytics\n  platforms\n  Secondary-dedicated data platforms like Launchbay Capital,\n  Forge, Hiive and Rainmaker are making it easier than ever for\n  institutional investors of all types to explore opportunities and\n  compare prices in private markets; something that until recently\n  was near impossible and reserved for PE professionals\n  exclusively. This newfound understanding and ability to make\n  informed decisions has played a substantial role in the uptake of\n  secondary investment opportunities by the various segments of\n  investing vehicles. \n\n\n  These data-driven platforms are highly impactful tools for family\n  offices, whether leveraging to inform their direct investment\n  decisions or to gain insights on the capital moves their fund\n  managers are recommending. Trackable analytics can be pulled on\n  specific companies or broader sectors to review recent share\n  prices, volume of trades, growth timelines and past, present and\n  future funding rounds, to gauge true areas for opportunity more\n  effectively. As investments are made, users can return to the\n  platform to monitor the progress of their investments while\n  staying closely informed in order to strategize future\n  decisions. \n\n\n  Another added benefit is that these platforms make the process of\n  doing business much more seamless. Once you’ve landed on a share\n  to purchase, the platform will provide the information for the\n  broker to contact with your inquiry. \n\n\n  Some may argue that the growing amount of secondary data that’s\n  become available through these platforms is blurring the lines\n  between public and private markets. Rather than sourcing major\n  investment houses’ underwritten share prices, analysts are now\n  frequenting estimates pulled from private market data to predict\n  how much major companies will be valued at when they go public.\n  We’ve seen this with Reddit, Stripe and even Pitchbook’s IPO\n  pipeline reports. The increasingly frequent use of secondary data\n  in major market news goes to show just how much credibility this\n  sector has gained, and in such a short timeline. \n\n\nMarkets trending through end-of-year\n  When considering where to start your family office’s venture into\n  private markets, it’s good to note that a majority of the\n  movement we’re seeing is within tech-related sectors. Currently,\n  and as no surprise, generative AI is dominating attention,\n  but not in the same way it was just a year ago. Ticket prices to\n  invest in top, privately held companies like OpenAI and Anthropic\n  are at an all-time high with little potential or reason for\n  discounts any time soon. Additionally, the AI framework has been\n  ultimately set in place by these major entities. \n\n\n  Rather, investor interests have shifted to companies that are\n  specializing in the business implementation of AI, like Cohere,\n  which recently locked in a $450 million investment from big-name\n  corporate investors to fund its platform that specializes in\n  developing large language models for enterprise chatbots, search\n  engines and copywriting. \n\n\n  Another leading sector is fintech, where companies like Stripe\n  and Klarna continue to serve as secondary poster children as they\n  head into their I and H funding rounds. Deployment and\n  implementation of AI within the fintech space has further\n  hastened this market’s capabilities and investor interest. \n\n\nSecondaries are here to stay\n  The expansion of secondary markets can be likened to opening\n  Pandora’s box. There’s a clear appetite for getting in on private\n  growth funding rounds – and not only by institutional investors.\n  As we’ve seen in recent news, Silicon Valley startups have been\n  pushing for greater access that would allow retail investors into\n  the space. \n\n\n  The US Securities and Exchange Commission even tried\n  its hand at setting new regulations that would enforce\n  greater transparency by private companies and investors to no\n  avail. Retail investors now have access to AI that’s leveraging\n  both public and private market data to provide investment paths\n  that are nearly on par with those mapped by institutional\n  traders. \n\n\n  The private market is headed in an array of directions, but\n  backwards certainly isn’t one of them. The capital power of the\n  market-reigning family offices ensures that they’re primed to\n  lead the pack. Whether your family office is seeking portfolio\n  diversification, liquidity, risk mitigation or access to\n  established companies, the growing opportunities to achieve these\n  goals through secondary investments are undeniable. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint (subject to copyright)\nRequest Reprint Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Credit Matures But Yet To Face Big Recession\n\n\n\n\n\nSandalwood Has Family Office Mindset In Its DNA\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Markets Ecosystem Says It Fixes Fragmented Sector \n\n\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Focus On Private Equity, Evergreen Portfolios – Hamilton Lane\n\n\n\n\n\nHow \"Evergreen\" Approach Wins Friends For Private Markets\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Real Estate Wealth Manager Unveils Enhancements, Sees Big Potential \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward Winners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthTalk - Awards Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards | 14 June  2023\nWize By Teamwork's Central Application Supports Growth \nDuration: 2.70m\n\n\n More Awards Videos\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthTalk - From The Editor’s Desk Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast | 30 October  2024\nWEALTH TALK: UK Millionaires And Non-Doms Depart – The Impact\nDuration: 18.25m\n\n\n More From the Editor's Desk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthTalk - Expert View Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Strategies | 24 October  2024\nWealthTalk – \"Autocracy Risk\" And What It Means For Investors\nDuration: 15.90m\n\n\n More Expert View Videos \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRegister for FamilyWealthReport today\n\n\nGain access to regular and exclusive research on the global wealth management sector along with the opportunity to attend industry events such as exclusive invites to Breakfast Briefings and Summits in the major wealth management centres and industry leading awards programmes\n\n\nRegister Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Stories\n\n\nKey Private Bank's MFO Arm Adds To Team\n\n\nCetera CEO To Stand Down, Successor Named\n\n\nWealth Managers Say Fed's Cut Was Expected, Seek Rate Clues From Trump's Agenda\n\n\nSchroders Names New UK Head, Americas CEO\n\n\nCallan Family Office Launches Tax Management Program\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\nGoldman Sachs Expands Family Office Offering\n\n\nMercer Advisors Targets Greater Denver, Colorado\n\n\nPre-Election Nerves Weighed On Hedge Fund Returns – HFR\n\n\nSymposium Preview: Helping Firms Adapt To Evolving UHNW Realities\n\n\nWealth Managers React To Trump Victory \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nContact\nAdvertise\nEditorial Board\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\n\n© Clearview Financial Media Ltd, 83 Victoria Street, London, SW1W 0HW, United Kingdom.
