But Hirschhorn warns that organisations need a strategic vision and disciplined, risk-aware, execution to avoid taking potentially damaging wrong turns.\n“We see data in the world around us increasing in volume and pace along with the opportunities and risk,” Hirschhorn told Data Management Insight.\nFor firms to be successful with AI, they need to ensure they have a solid foundation around ethics, privacy and usage right policies in place or else they will risk losing the trust of their user base or worse.\nSummit Opener\nHirschhorn will kick off the summit on 26th September with the Practitioner Innovation Keynote Address entitled “Unlocking the power of AI for data driven innovation, business growth and efficiencies at BNY”. He will touch on how the US-based banking giant is approaching AI and how the technology is already benefiting its operations.\nThe delivery will be among several during the day that will tackle the topic of AI and how institutions can extract value from the technology.\nWhile Hirschhorn argues that the new “coastline of opportunity” offered by generative AI (GenAI) is intoxicating and that it promises to make us “more effective and more insightful”, he says that without careful implementation, organisations could find themselves going down multiple legal problematic rabbit holes.\n“Those who will be most successful, are those who have started thinking about data in terms of policy-driven inputs and governed output,” Hirschhorn said.\nLimitless Benefits\nThe solution is simple, he suggests: organisations need to be risk managers every day when using AI. With those safeguards in place, the benefits of AI are limitless.\nAs well as bringing quantifiable financial value to an organisation, AI can have a dramatic impact on the softer aspects of corporate operations; a better work life balance for professionals as machines take up routine tasks and let them focus on more rewarding activities, for instance, and improved customer engagement.\n“If we take a risk-adjusted approach, we’d find we’d be racing forward on some topics and more cautious on others,” he says.\n“Our framework for rolling this out across the enterprise is market-leading; not in the Star Wars sense but in that methodical discipline, a sense of urgency and a sense of safety will drive outcomes at pace,” Hirschhorn adds. “We’re a bank – be a bank, but don’t be stodgy, don’t be slow, don’t be old; be fleet of foot but be risk-managed.”\n\nA-Team Group’s 14 annual Data Management Summit New York City will be held on 26 Click here to register or sign up for attendance below.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to buy ticketsSell tickets online with Ticket Tailor \nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Management Insight  \nDataData Delivery Platforms, Cloud & Managed Services Share article \nLinkedInXFacebookEmailShare \n\nRelated content\n\n\nwebinars\n\nRecorded Webinar: AI in Asset Management: Buy-Side Attitudes toward GenAI and LLMs\nFind out more\n\n\n08 October 2024\n\nData Management Insight  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\nWEBINAR\n\n\nRecorded Webinar: Augmented data quality: Leveraging AI, machine learning and automation to build trust in your data\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are empowering financial institutions to get more from their data.
