Let's dive in.\n\nExecutives in financial services are embracing the transformative potential of Generative AI (GAI). According to a recent FintechOS survey of 502 senior decision-makers, 73% anticipate eventual job displacement. üòÆ\n\nü§î The sentiments around GAI vary widely, from excitement over productivity gains to concerns about potential job losses. Yet, despite these apprehensions, over half of large institutions are already investing in GAI. Particularly, they're focusing on customer service, with an eye on automating new business queries and lending processes. \n\nHowever, there's no consensus on the leading applications of GAI, including customer service, credit checks, lending, and data analytics. The study also reveals differing opinions on who should own the GAI strategy, with chief security and chief operations officers in contention. ü§ù\n\nüí° While GAI adoption is expected to drive revenue growth, with two-thirds predicting a 10-30% increase in the next three years, uncertainties persist about its broader impact and potential disruption in the financial services industry. Financial institutions must navigate the dual nature of GAI as both a security and efficiency play, proactively shaping its implementation to stay competitive and leverage its capabilities for personalized offerings and accelerated innovation. \n \n#FinancialServices #AI #Innovation\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    2\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              SF Startup Resources\n            \n \n\n                109 followers\n            \n\n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      3w\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow JPMorgan Chase is preparing the workforce for the future of AI\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n              How JPMorgan Chase is preparing the workforce for the future of AI\n            \n\n                jpmorganchase.com\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Mike Doherty, PMI-ACP\n            \n \n\n                Transforming Urban Landscapes: Experts in Green, Sustainable Spaces & Community Engagement\n            \n\n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      3w\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow JPMorgan Chase is preparing the workforce for the future of AI\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n              How JPMorgan Chase is preparing the workforce for the future of AI\n            \n\n                jpmorganchase.com\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Alexandra Mousavizadeh\n            \n\nAlexandra Mousavizadeh is an Influencer\n \n\n                CEO Evident\n            \n\n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      4mo\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLatest insight from The Brief: Is London losing its AI mojo? \n\nWhile some top-tier AI start-ups like Google DeepMind and Arm were born there, and in Europe the U.K. attracts a large share of VC activity, the center of AI innovation is clearly on the move.\n\nHowever, that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a good market for talent in London. Microsoft and OpenAI opened European hubs in London this year, and Google bought DeepMind more than a decade ago. \n\nBanks are hiring fast too. In the last six months, the number of AI development roles at the 50 Evident AI Index banks has grown faster in London ‚Äì up 6.1% ‚Äì than other major hubs like New York (+3.7%) and Toronto (+5.9%). Read more in our latest AI Talent report: https://lnkd.in/guSMttgG\n\nBut most of those jobs are at non-British companies. In the City, AI developers are twice as likely to be working for foreign banks as British ones. \n\nThat‚Äôs not to say British banks aren‚Äôt driving toward AI maturity. At last month‚Äôs Evident AI Symposium in London, Zachery Anderson of NatWest Group spoke about how they‚Äôve improved the speed at which they can find value from AI use cases. And Barclays recently created a Center of Excellence for generative AI, as Kristen Bennie explained.
