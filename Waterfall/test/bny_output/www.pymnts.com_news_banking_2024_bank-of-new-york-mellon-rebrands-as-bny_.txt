Its legal parent name will remain The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.\n“As the world changes and global financial markets evolve, so do we,” the bank said in its announcement. “To improve familiarity with who we are and what we do, we are updating our logo and simplifying our company umbrella brand to BNY.”\nThe original Bank of New York was founded in 1781 by Alexander Hamilton, with fellow founding fathers Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson among its shareholders. The bank merged with Mellon Financial in 2007.\nBNY now oversees close to $50 trillion in assets and is known as a custodian bank or a bank for other lenders.\nAs part of the rebrand, the bank’s investment management and wealth management arms will also be renamed BNY Investments and BNY Wealth, and its financial solutions unit, BNY Mellon Pershing, will become BNY Pershing.\n“These changes complement the company’s evolution as a leading global financial services company,” said BNY Global Head of Marketing and Communications Natalie Sunderland.\n“The updated brand conveys trust, resilience and innovation, and helps us align the full breadth of our offerings and capabilities under one brand, to improve familiarity with who we are and all that we do for our clients.”\nBNY’s big change comes as the entire banking industry is changing amid the rise of digital banking, as noted here last month.\nIt has led banks to adopt a practice from the retail world known as “clienteling,” which means “that the folks who walk into the branch are the very customers that the bank wants to be there … the high value, repeat business relationships that last a long time,” PYMNTS wrote.\nIn retail terms, clienteling involves the strategy of assigning individual sales associates in the store to consumers — a one-on-one interaction that uses data to create a personalized approach that addresses the customer’s needs and preferences for that visit while also improving the efficiency of the visit.\n“The reimagining of the branch has been a key endeavor for banks precisely because so many functions previously fulfilled by tellers and bankers — from deposits to loan applications — can now be done on a mobile device,” PYMNTS wrote.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\nHouse Republicans Blast 'Undue Scrutiny' of Bank-FinTech Partnerships\n\n\nUber One Memberships Jump 78% as Company Eyes Non-City Growth\n\n\nOpenAI Expands ChatGPT With Web Search, Taking Aim at Google’s Territory\n\n\nRoblox: Engaging Bigger Kids With Better Content Drives More Payments\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    Bank of New York Mellon, banking, Banks, BNY, BNY Investments, BNY Pershing, BNY Wealth, Digital Banking, investment banking, News, PYMNTS News, What's Hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                            IPO Market Struggles as Investors Flock to AI            \n\n\n\n\n\nBy\n\nPYMNTS \n | \nNovember 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture capital firms are reportedly struggling amid a lack of mergers, acquisitions and public listings.\nIt’s a situation that has led to a liquidity drought as artificial intelligence (AI) startups draw investor attention, CNBC reported Thursday (Nov. 14).\n“In the U.S., when you talk about the presidential election, it’s the economy stupid. And in the VC world, it’s really all about liquidity stupid,” Edith Yeung, general partner at Race Capital, a Silicon Valley early-stage venture capital (VC) firm, said at CNBC-hosted the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.\nYeung said the lack of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the past few years had fostered a “really tough” environment for the VC world. Meanwhile, investors are clamoring to back AI companies.\n“What’s really crazy is in the last few years, OpenAI’s domination has really been determined by Big Techs, the Microsofts of the world,” Yeung said.\nLarry Aschebrook, founder and managing partner at late-stage VC firm G Squared, agreed that the search for liquidity is getting harder — even though companies such as OpenAI are enjoying massive funding rounds, which he called “a bit nuts.”\n“You have funds and founders and employees searching for liquidity because the IPO market is not happening,” Aschebrooke said. “And then you have funding rounds taking place for generational types of businesses.”\nAs PYMNTS wrote last year, AI companies raised $11.8 billion during the third quarter of this year, accounting for approximately 30% of total VC investments worldwide.\n“The AI sector remains a long-term growth opportunity for VC investors despite the volatility seen in recent months,” Stocklytics wrote. “Although they are being more selective about which AI startups to back, the overall interest remains strong, and Crunchbase data proves this.”\nAlthough this figure marks a slight drop from prior quarters, Stocklytics reports it represents the sixth-largest quarterly funding total in the sector’s history. The number of deals decreased 28% year-over-year to 79, but more substantial investments, such as a $1 billion round for Safe Superintelligence, have helped to lift overall funding levels.\nAI startups had — as of that writing — raised a record $53 billion for the year, exceeding the $49.4 billion raised in the entirety of 2021. This brings funding in the AI sector to over $241 billion, with U.S. companies, especially those in California, securing nearly 65% of the total.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\nIPO Market Struggles as Investors Flock to AI\n\n\nApple’s AI-Powered Smart Home Hub May Include eCommerce Capabilities\n\n\nHow 21st Century CISOs Balance AI Risks Against Rewards\n\n\nMeta to Appeal EC Decision in Facebook Marketplace Antitrust Case\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    acquisitions, AI, AI investments, artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, Investments, IPOs, mergers, News, PYMNTS News, VC, Venture Capital, venture funding, What's Hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                IPO Market Struggles as Investors Flock to AI            \n\n\n\n\n                Apple’s AI-Powered Smart Home Hub May Include eCommerce Capabilities            \n\n\n\n\n                How 21st Century CISOs Balance AI Risks Against Rewards            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Efficient Working Capital Practices Drive Nearly $10M in Bottom Line Benefits for Top North American CFOs            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                MoneyLion CEO: Checkout Extends Our Evolution From Neobank to Financial Services Marketplace            \n\n\n\n\n                The Cash Flow Management Secret Weapon CFOs Didn't Know They Had            \n\n\n\n\n                Report: Global CFOs Say Access to the Right Working Capital Solutions Remains Challenging            \n\n\n\n\n                Discover Global Network: Advanced Analytics Forges Proactive Approach to Battling Fraudsters            \n\n\n\n\n                Digital-First Banking’s Mantra: Check Friction at the Virtual Front Door            \n\n\n\n\n                Nearly Three-Quarters of Small Businesses Using Embedded Lending Access Bigger Credit Lines            \n\n\n\n\n                AI Content Creation Tools Aim to Rewrite How Companies Sell Online            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn error occurred.
