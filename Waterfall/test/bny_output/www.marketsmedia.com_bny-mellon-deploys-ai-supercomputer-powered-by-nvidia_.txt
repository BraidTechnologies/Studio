Its AI Hub has more than 20 AI-enabled solutions in production. These solutions support predictive analytics, automation and anomaly detection, among other capabilities.\nWhile the firm recognizes that AI presents opportunities to enhance its processes to reduce risk across the organization, it is also actively working to consider and manage potential risks associated with AI through its robust risk management and governance processes.\nSome of the use cases supported by DGX SuperPOD include deposit forecasting, payment automation, predictive trade analytics and end-of-day cash balances.\nMore are coming. The company identified more than 600 opportunities in AI during a firmwide exercise last year, and dozens are already in development using such NVIDIA AI Enterprise software as NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA Base Command.\nTriton Inference Server is inference-serving software that streamlines AI inferencing or puts trained AI models to work.\nBase Command powers the DGX SuperPOD, delivering the best of NVIDIA software that enables businesses and their data scientists to accelerate AI development.\nNeMo is an end-to-end platform for developing custom generative AI, anywhere. It includes tools for training, and retrieval-augmented generation, guardrailing and toolkits, data curation tools, and pretrained models, offering enterprises an easy, cost-effective, and fast way to adopt generative AI.\nFueling Innovation Through Top Talent\nWith the new DGX SuperPOD, these tools will enable BNY Mellon to streamline and accelerate innovation within the firm and across the global financial system.\nHundreds of data scientists, solutions architects and risk, control and compliance professionals have been using the NVIDIA DGX platform, which delivers the world’s leading solutions for enterprise AI development at scale, for several years.\nBNY Mellon’s new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD will help the company rapidly expand its on-premises AI infrastructure.\nThe system also promises to help the company continue to innovate and attract top talent in the financial services industry.\nSource: BNY Mellon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSLETTER SIGN UP\nAnd receive exclusive articles on securities markets\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets Media\n\n\n Follow                \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital publisher covering trading & technology in capital markets. @marketsmedia @traders_tweets @FIXGlobalOnline @TheBondDesk @BestExecution @DerivSource                \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets Media\n@marketsmedia\n·\n\n13 Sep 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs Technology Evolves, Asset Managers Adapt and Innovate\n\n\n\n Reply on Twitter 1702005834081821046\n\n Retweet on Twitter 1702005834081821046\n\n\n\n Like on Twitter 1702005834081821046\n4\n\n\nTwitter\n1702005834081821046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets Media\n@marketsmedia\n·\n\n13 Sep 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCiti Changes Organizational Structure\n\n\n\n Reply on Twitter 1701949103419048274\n\n Retweet on Twitter 1701949103419048274\n\n\n\n Like on Twitter 1701949103419048274\n\n\n\nTwitter\n1701949103419048274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets Media\n@marketsmedia\n·\n\n13 Sep 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEC Charges Virtu for Disclosures Relating to Information Barriers\n\n\n\n Reply on Twitter 1701875573344157802\n\n Retweet on Twitter 1701875573344157802\n\n\n\n Like on Twitter 1701875573344157802\n\n\n\nTwitter\n1701875573344157802\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets Media\n@marketsmedia\n·\n\n13 Sep 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n\nICE Futures Singapore Partners with CoinDesk Indices\n\n\n\n Reply on Twitter 1701870991540895961\n\n Retweet on Twitter 1701870991540895961\n\n\n\n Like on Twitter 1701870991540895961\n\n\n\nTwitter\n1701870991540895961\n\n\n \nLoad More\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Related articles\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Markets\n\n\nbig xyt Secures €10m Funding Round\n\n\n\nInvestment will support the financial markets AI-analytics firm's global expansion.\n\n\n11.13.2024\nBy Shanny Basar                                                        , Senior Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Markets\n\n\nArk 51 Uses AI to Convert ISDA CSAs into Digital Form\n\n\n\nThis increases efficiencies and reduces operational risks in the collateral management ecosystem.\n\n\n11.06.2024\nBy Shanny Basar                                                        , Senior Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Email Feature\n\n\nA Data Strategy to Future-Proof Investment Operations\n\n\n\nA Markets Media webinar discussed how firms are changing data management and the role of AI.\n\n\n11.04.2024\nBy Markets Media                                                        , \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Email Feature\n\n\nInvestment Association to Widen Discussion on AI\n\n\n\nThe advent of generative AI marks a paradigm shift for fund management.\n\n\n10.30.2024\nBy Shanny Basar                                                        , Senior Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Markets\n\n\nMorgan Stanley Research Launches AskResearchGPT\n\n\n\nThe gen AI-based assistant augments the AskResearch chatbot to pinpoint data, key findings & analyst ratings.\n\n\n10.24.2024\nBy Shanny Basar                                                        , Senior Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\nCareers\nContact\nAdvertise\nNewsletter\nCorporate Site\n \n\n\nFacebookTwitter\nLinkedIn\nVimeo \n\n\n\n\n© 2023 Markets Media Holdings LLC\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
