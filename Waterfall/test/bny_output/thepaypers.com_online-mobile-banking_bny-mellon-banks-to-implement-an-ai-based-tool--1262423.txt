Improving the in-house solution would have been time-consuming, so the bank turned to a third-party vendor, Quantexa, a British software developer that uses machine learning and multiple public data sources to enhance the entity resolution process. Quantexa's software platform can not only do entity resolution but also map networks of connections in the data - who trades with whom, who shares an address, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key challenge in this endeavour is being able to identify all the data related to an individual customer and to identify the relationships that link that customer with others. Banks have a regulatory requirement to know whom they are dealing with, often referred to as KYC to meet anti-money laundering and other obligations.\nBeing able to identify which of many loans have been made to the same person or company is also important for banks to manage their risk exposure. The problem is not unique to banks, as a wide range of companies can benefit from a better understanding of their exposure to individual suppliers or customers.\nTherefore, recognising that divisions already had their own spending priorities, the bank set aside a central budget that each division could draw on to hire developers to ensure they all had the resources to implement this customer master. With the work of harmonising customer definitions out of the way, the bank could focus on eliminating duplicates.\nBNY Mellon had built some sophisticated software itself to disambiguate its own customer database. There was some automation around the process, but the software still required manual intervention to resolve some cases, and the bank needed something better.\n\n\nBNY’s recent developments\nIn December 2023, Conduent partnered with BNY Mellon to launch a Digital Integrated Payments Hub that expands access to payments to businesses and public sector agencies. Having integrated BNY Mellon’s infrastructure payment capabilities, Conduent’s Digital Integrated Payments Hub expedites refunds, rebates, and overpayment remediations in a matter of minutes, while simultaneously offering the possibility of tracking transactions in a convenient and transparent manner.\nMoreover, BNY Mellon partnered with B2B financial marketplace Fiserv to expand real-time FX rate quotes for payments from US financial institutions.Through this partnership, financial institutions that use Fiserv’s  Payments Exchange: Foreign Exchange Services will also receive access to BNY Mellon's real-time FX rate quotes in more than 120 countries. The collaboration allows US-based financial institutions to execute currency conversions for cross-border payments while benefiting from rate visibility upfront.Source:  Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Headlines in your E-mail\n\nEvery day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.\n            \n        \n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords:\nbanks, artificial intelligence, data, KYC, AML\n\n\nCategories:\n Banking & Fintech\n\n\nCompanies:\nBNY Mellon\n\n\nCountries:\nWorld\n\n\n\n::: add a comment\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis article is part of category\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanking & Fintech\n\n::: more\n\n\n\n\n\nBNY Mellon|\n\nDiscover all the Company news on BNY Mellon and other articles related to BNY Mellon in The Paypers News, Reports, and insights on the payments and fintech industry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoice of the Industry\n\n\n14:17\n\n\n\t                    Ecommerce is driving the Europeanisation of the (Digital) Single Market\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\n\t                    Addressing key checkout friction points to boost conversion\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n11 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) challenges and best practices\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n8 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Cracking down on refund fraud and promo abuse: protecting your business from costly scams \n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n8 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Merchant payments trends driving change through 2025\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n::: more voices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviews\n\n\n12 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Open Banking: transforming lending, payments, and financial support\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n6 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Top 5 fraud challenges facing financial institutions\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n6 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Tourist taxes part two: their impact on the aviation industry \n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n5 Nov\n\n\n\t                    Tourist taxes part one: their history, current landscape, and case studies \n\t                \n\n\n\n\n\n4 Nov\n\n\n\t                    The importance of a holistic approach to fighting fraud and ensuring compliance\n\t                \n\n\n\n\n::: more interviews\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Events\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Nov\n\n\nWeb Summit -
