As my direct manager, he created positive working atmosphere, maintaining  proper balance among supervision, coaching and support. Rajeev has always acted in professional manner, managing to effectively juggle tasks and deliver the results in challenging environment, while never loosing positive attitude and good sense of humor.”\n      \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Artur Leciewicz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          “I met Rajeev late 2004 when he came to Poland to put in order a credit portfolio which has been in a severe stress. He not only prevented the portfolio to fall off the cliff but managed it to recover and helped the business to rearrange for growth mode, by introducing several controls & procedure manuals, credit program, MIS & portfolio management standards and system enhancement.\n\nRajeev demonstrated highly unique skill of being interdisciplinary while working with legal, finance, IT, product heads, operations and many others departments.\n\nAs a boss and manager of managers he was very challenging as he sets high standards. At the same time he knows well how to balance delegations, supervision and coaching. I owe him a lot as the time we worked together was a great lesson to me in my development. Rajeev was a great boss, great leader, great man.\n\nWhen he decided to move on with his career and left Poland in early 2007 to join Egypt as Risk Head the portfolio in Poland has been in a great shape and well balanced between risk vs reward.\n\nThe three years we cooperated with each other have been definitely ones of the most challenging and developing I have had in my career. It was a pleasure to work with Rajeev.”\n      \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              9 people have recommended Rajeev\n            \n\n                Join now to view\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              More activity by Rajeev\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n          \n          Thank you to all our clients for their continuing support to Citi Commercial Bank and for taking the time out to attend the event.\n      \n      \n          \n\n\n\n \n\n \n            \n          Thank you to all our clients for their continuing support to Citi Commercial Bank and for taking the time out to attend the event.\n      \n          \n\n              \n        Liked by Rajeev Bhatnagar\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n          \n          The only person you should compete with is the person you were yesterday. 🙏🏻\n      \n      \n          \n\n\n\n \n\n \n            \n          The only person you should compete with is the person you were yesterday. 🙏🏻\n      \n          \n\n              \n        Liked by Rajeev Bhatnagar\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n          \n          Professor Naveed Sultan addressed an esteemed gathering of central bankers, senior banking executives, academics, and technology professionals at the…\n      \n      \n          \n\n\n\n \n\n \n            \n          Professor Naveed Sultan addressed an esteemed gathering of central bankers, senior banking executives, academics, and technology professionals at the…\n      \n          \n\n              \n        Liked by Rajeev Bhatnagar\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n          \n          Insightful discussion last week at the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) Global Risk Forum in Hong Kong.

UK Finance reports that fraud losses soared to £580 million in the first half of 2023. This statistic shows the critical importance for payment professionals to understand the rapidly growing fraud landscape.\n\nOne alarming trend is the increase in authorised push payment (APP) fraud. In these scams, fraudsters deceive individuals into authorising payments to accounts controlled by them.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, payment professionals must stay ahead of the latest fraud tactics and implement advanced strategies and cutting-edge technologies. This involves implementing real-time fraud detection systems, using strong authentication methods and keeping up with regulatory changes.\n\nHave you come across similar frauds? \nWishing you a fraudless business!\n\n#Amaiz #Bottomline #FraudPrevention #PaymentSecurity #CyberSecurity #APPFraud #OpenBanking #DigitalPayments #FraudDetection 🚀🔒\n📚  Discover more, download the report 👉https://lnkd.in/ekTkfbhZ\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    7\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                1 Comment\n            \n      \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Achilleas Papadakis\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          ❗ Supervisors continue to emphasise the key role that the robustness of banks’ counterparty credit risk (CCR) management practices plays in reducing the perceived risk stemming from NBFIs.\n🏛 Banks should be looking to improve their CCR arrangements not only to contend with rising supervisory expectations, but to position themselves to weather storms better in an environment of increased funding costs, tighter financing conditions, and increased volatility.\n\n#Deloitte's EMEA Centre for Regulatory Strategy (ECRS) analysed the #PRA, #FCA, #ECB and #BCBS expectations on CCR management and identified five priority areas which feature in many of them, indicating that supervisors around the world are thinking about the risk issues along similar lines\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    27\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Chris Potts\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          UK - FCA, CP24/17: Enhancing the National Storage Mechanism \n\nThe Regulator is consulting on proposals to change the requirements for submitting regulated information to the National Storage Mechanism (NSM). \n\nRead CP24/17 (PDF) Why we are consulting We want to introduce more comprehensive data requirements to improve the NSM’s functionality. \n\nThis will make it easier for NSM users to find information submitted by regulated market issuers.

According to Piyush Shukla, money mules in India do much more than move money. A MULE ACCOUNT IS a bank account that receives funds from illegal activities and then transfers those funds to other accounts, thus serving as a bridge for money laundering and other illegal practices to take place. \n\nIt is not uncommon in India to come across people who are opening mule accounts based on their bank accounts that they are offering in place of money as payment. The account holder's onboarding process is not automated in this way, which makes it more difficult to detect such accounts.

The European Risk Management Council has released the Q4 2024 Risk Sentiment Index (RSI) for the UK, US, and APAC. In this article, I analyse the RSI data to provide insights into the perceptions of CROs regarding the risk landscape for financial services in 2025. Key findings:\n\n·        Cyber risk is ranked as the number one risk for 2025 across all three markets.\n·        Operational risk is expected to rise rapidly. CROs are increasingly concerned that advanced digital technologies, such as AI, could be weaponised by criminals to exploit vulnerabilities in financial institutions and their clients.\n·        CROs across all three markets agree that credit risk is no longer a primary concern for 2025. Remarkably, for the first time since we launched RSI surveys in 2018, credit risk does not rank among the top three risks in any of the regions surveyed.\n\nMany thanks to all RSI survey respondents.\n\nPlease read the article here: https://lnkd.in/eF7TRWHN\n\n\n #riskmanagement #risk #cro\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    48\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          SHIWANGI SARAF\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          On 30 November 2022, the PRA published CP 16/22 for proposed implementation of Basel 3.1 standards in UK. The guidelines will have a key impact on the credit risk landscape in the country. The PRAs proposal are set to redefine the UK Banking sector's competitive landscape as well:\n\n1) The proposals are expected to open up certain lower risk segments to mid-tier firms, whilst also encouraging larger lenders to pursue certain higher risk segments.\n\n2) The market structure is expected to fundamentally change from a relatively concentrated model to a more diversified model where large and mid tier firms may operate in overlapping segments.\n\nDo you agree? \n\n#Basel3.1 #PRA #UKFinance\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    2\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Raul Morales Resendiz\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          Why payments need to be borne as 'public goods'?\n\nThis Federal Reserve Board Governor Waller's speech put it simpler (in 2 complementary ways):\n\n1. Identifying the need and timing for technical standards, incorporating a breadth of industry perspectives, and aligning on implementation approaches requires 'coordination', and central banks play a key role as neutral conveners to harmonise efforts from all relevant stakeholders.\n\n2. Leading by example, central banks' operated payment platforms provide expertise in the adoption of standards and best practices. RTGS systems remain as the backbone of the financial system, they serve as rails for safe and efficient settlement in central bank money\n\n#RTGS #payments #ISO20022 #standards #innovation\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    30\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Robert Evans\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              \n          🚨 The Wolfsberg Group recently published their 'Principles for Auditing a Financial Crime Risk Management Programme for Effectiveness'. But how much do we know about them, and are they being correctly applied during your financial crime audit?\n\nWhile I was on holiday last week the team at FINTRAIL ran a webinar on auditing for effectiveness. At the start we asked our audience, \"How familiar are you with the Wolfsberg factors and principles?\". 88% responded that they were 'somewhat familiar' or 'not familiar'.\n\nAfter an hour-long deep dive, we asked the crowd, \"In light of the Wolfsberg Group’s recent update, do you consider assessing effectiveness an important part of your audit?\". 77% responded 'Yes, very important'.\n\nThe consensus is clear: auditing for effectiveness is key. Good job then that FINTRAIL have already aligned our audit and assurance methodologies with the Wolfsberg principles.\n\nHopefully you were able to join last week's session and feel more confident about applying the Wolfsberg principles during any upcoming audit, model validation or BAU assurance activities.
