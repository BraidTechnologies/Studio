The introduction of contextual analytics and innovation will enable HSBC to concentrate our resources more productively and ultimately help our customers.\"\n\nQuantexa claims that a tier one global financial institution with three levels of defence in financial crime and fraud compliance efforts, generating approximately 15k alerts a month, could make over £17 million in savings a year by using the technology for investigating and reporting processes across financial crime and fraud.\nDiscover new challenges and opportunities artificial intelligence brings to the banking sector at Finextra's first NextGenAI conference on November 26 2024.
