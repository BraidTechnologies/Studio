These virtual accounts enable real-time reflection of incoming and outgoing payments, maintaining a virtual sub-ledger that offers continuously updated transaction and balance history.\nOne of the key advantages of virtual accounts is the flexibility they offer clients, the release said. Instead of opening multiple physical accounts with different banks, clients can now reflect their desired account structures through virtual accounts.\nBNY Mellon’s Virtual Account-Based solutions cater to various industry use cases, according to the press release. They enable the automatic reconciliation of high volumes of incoming payments over USD wires and ACH networks, accurate identification of payment remitters, and reconciliation of receivables by client, business, invoice and more.\nThe solutions also support the centralization of payment and collection functions across legal entities, the release said. They support Payments on Behalf Of (POBO), Collections on Behalf Of (COBO) and In-House Bank structures.\nAdditionally, the solutions allow for the establishment of a hierarchy of virtual accounts exclusive to specific business units, properties, divisions, geographies or purposes, per the release. This provides a segregated view of cash and transactions without the need to manage a large number of physical bank accounts.\nThe solutions also offer advantages to financial institution clients, according to the release. By segregating physical Nostro accounts, these clients can utilize them for their end corporate clients to receive wires or ACH credits in the U.S.\nPYMNTS Intelligence has found that 54% of chief financial officers cite liquidity and cash management as a top challenge. These decision-makers need real-time visibility and control over a growing array of banking accounts, as well as powerful tools that can help them make projections, according to the “Corporate Cash Management Playbook,” a PYMNTS collaboration with Red Hat, Infosys Finacle and Intel.\nIn another recent product launch, BNY Mellon said in October that it launched a White Labeling service for its LiquidityDirect platform, enabling financial institutions to offer their clients liquidity management solutions.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\nHouse Republicans Blast 'Undue Scrutiny' of Bank-FinTech Partnerships\n\n\nUber One Memberships Jump 78% as Company Eyes Non-City Growth\n\n\nOpenAI Expands ChatGPT With Web Search, Taking Aim at Google’s Territory\n\n\nRoblox: Engaging Bigger Kids With Better Content Drives More Payments\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    B2B, B2B Payments, banking, BNY Mellon, business banking, Cash Management, commercial payments, News, PYMNTS News, virtual accounts, What's Hot, What's Hot In B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                            DebtBook Debuts Cash Management Tool for Treasurers            \n\n\n\n\n\nBy\n\nPYMNTS \n | \nNovember 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebtBook has debuted a tool designed to help customers manage cash flow and liquidity.\nThe company, which makes cloud-based software solutions for governments and nonprofits, debuted its Cash Management solution Wednesday (Nov. 13), saying this tool is designed for cash managers, treasurers and finance teams.\n“The introduction of Cash Management represents an important milestone in accomplishing our mission,” Tyler Traudt, DebtBook co-founder and CEO, said in a news release. “This solution significantly eliminates the operational hurdles so many teams are fighting, and it enables them to take on the strategic work that they crave and that their organizations and communities need.”\nAccording to the release, Cash Management is designed to improve financial performance and lower risks for government and nonprofit finance teams. The tool’s cash forecasting capabilities let teams make more accurate cash forecasts, allowing them to invest and borrow more strategically, thus raising revenues and cutting costs.\n“By enabling continuous monitoring of all bank accounts and flagging unusual activity, we help teams reduce the risk of fraud,” the release said. “And by automating real-time daily cash positioning, our solution helps reduce errors and create meaningful productivity gains.”\nPYMNTS examined the challenges of maintaining optimal liquidity amid more diverse cash management workflows earlier this year in an interview with Noam Mills, CEO at Panax.\n“Cash flow can be a blind spot for the finance team,” Mills told PYMNTS, adding that traditional cash flow management can often depend on manual processes and reactive measures.\nDrawing on her own finance experience at a global eCommerce business, she noted that treasury teams are often “chasing their own tails just to understand where they are and to make decisions.”\nHowever, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) means that modern solutions that leverage innovation are playing an increasingly pivotal role in automating and streamlining financial processes for complex treasury organizations.\n“The key word here is complexity. And complexity can arise from many different sources, whether it’s the holding structure or the nature of the business,” Mills said.\nMore recently, PYMNTS discussed the integration of automation and AI into treasury management with Albert Acevedo, senior vice president of treasury services at Priority.\n“There’s a lot of automation decision-making already in place,” he said, with AI becoming more crucial in improving forecasting and pattern recognition capabilities.\nThe challenge lies in effectively weaving these new technologies into existing processes, making sure they complement business operations and not disrupt them.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\nDebtBook Debuts Cash Management Tool for Treasurers\n\n\nJudge Denies Meta Motion to Dismiss FTC Antitrust Lawsuit\n\n\nAmazon Launches $20-or-Less Discount Store ‘Amazon Haul’\n\n\nMastercard to Shift to Tokenization and Biometric Authentication by 2030\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    B2B, B2B Payments, cash flow, Cash Management, commercial payments, DebtBook, liquidity, News, PYMNTS News, spend management, treasurers, treasury, treasury management, What's Hot, What's Hot In B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                DebtBook Debuts Cash Management Tool for Treasurers            \n\n\n\n\n                Judge Denies Meta Motion to Dismiss FTC Antitrust Lawsuit            \n\n\n\n\n                Amazon Launches $20-or-Less Discount Store ‘Amazon Haul’            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Efficient Working Capital Practices Drive Nearly $10M in Bottom Line Benefits for Top North American CFOs            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Banks Target Account Opening Tech to Avoid Deposit Drift’s ‘Death by 1,000 Cuts’            \n\n\n\n\n                Panel: Small Businesses Want Control, Automation Gives It to Them            \n\n\n\n\n                Buy, Build or Partner?
