One of the largest banks on the planet is building advanced, generative artificial intelligence tools that help clients make data-based decisions. And both world-class organizations are merging their future-altering, mind-bending brilliance in downtown Pittsburgh.Since 2018, the collaboration between the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation program at Carnegie Mellon University and the AI Hub at BNY is drawing recent graduates from the school’s Oakland campus to work in the financial services company’s downtown Pittsburgh headquarters, according to Christopher Martin, senior director of BNY’s AI Hub.“The AI Hub is an organization that brings together AI experts at BNY across our global footprint,” says Martin, who began leading the Pittsburgh team earlier this year. “We’re one of the largest footprints here in Pittsburgh and are growing significantly with our partnership with Carnegie Mellon.”Some early-career employees are helping BNY’s lines of business deliver better and faster outcomes for their stakeholders through Eliza, the financial services company’s cutting-edge AI platform, while others are focusing on risk and governance, as the company’s AI efforts goes from proof-of-concept into production. The emergent tech scene in downtown Pittsburgh is connecting creators, innovators, data scientists and financial whizzes across city neighborhoods – and around the world.Will Flanagan, senior associate data scientist for AI risk management at BNY and a recent CMU graduate, sees huge benefits to BNY fielding so many AI Hub team members from the school.“It’s a super comfortable environment to work in since we all come from a somewhat standardized background and can heavily depend on one another to do solid work,” Flanagan says.The MSAII program is a strong source of high-caliber talent for the AI Hub at BNY, with many students joining as summer interns or campus analysts following graduation. While the AI initiatives have an international impact – the global financial services company has offices on nearly every continent – much of the early-career talent contributing to the success of AI Hub has fully embraced the charms of living in downtown, footsteps away from BNY’s offices on Grant and Ross streets.After living in different cities within and outside of the United States, BNY Senior Data Scientist Shruti Nair says she chose to live in downtown Pittsburgh when she finished her MSAII degree and began working full-time at BNY in 2023. She said she likes that the neighborhood is never too quiet or too loud.“Every weekend feels lively and active in the city,” Nair says. “One of the perks of living in downtown has been the ability to hear events and watch fireworks at different stadiums right from my window.”Beyond eliminating a commute by living within walking distance to work, Nair says she grew up in the suburbs and wanted to experience city life for a while.Flanagan, who lives in the Cultural District, says he sees Pittsburgh’s theater and art scene as a huge differentiator among similar cities.“Downtown is where everything is for me,” Flanagan says, adding that he values the walkability of downtown Pittsburgh. “Work is a short walk away, the theaters are a block away, and restaurants galore can be found all over downtown.”our partnersget the  updatesPrivacy Policy (opens in new tab)Terms of Use (opens in new tab)Cookie Policy (opens in new tab)Accessibility Statement (opens in new tab)Consent PreferencesSubmit inquiries and stories related to IndexPGH: info@indexpgh.com"
