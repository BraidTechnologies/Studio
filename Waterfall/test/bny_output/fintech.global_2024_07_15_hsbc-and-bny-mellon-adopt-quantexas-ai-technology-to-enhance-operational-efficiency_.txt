The introduction of contextual analytics and innovation will enable HSBC to concentrate our resources more productively and ultimately help our customers.”Quantexa asserts that a top-tier global financial institution dealing with three levels of financial crime and fraud compliance, generating about 15,000 alerts monthly, could save over £17 million annually by using this technology for investigative and reporting processes in financial crime and fraud.Keep up with all the latest FinTech news here.Copyright © 2024 FinTech Global  Enjoying the stories?Subscribe to our daily FinTech newsletter and get the latest industry news & research                  InvestorsThe following investor(s) were tagged in this article.TAGSAIGenAIHSBCRegTechreportingPrevious article11 different countries recorded FinTech deals this week – Here are this week’s 15 FinTech dealsNext articleBlackRock allocates $150bn for decarbonisation fundshslade  RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Corporate Assessment & ReportingWhat do financial services companies need to know about carbon accounting?
