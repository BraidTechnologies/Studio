With a history spanning over 230 years, BNY Mellon has consistently been at the forefront of financial innovation. One of their groundbreaking initiatives, the Wove Platform, aims to revolutionize financial advisory by integrating versatile functionalities and advanced analytics for financial advisors. My engagements with BNY Mellon, starting in March 2023 through Artium, where I serve as a Staff Software Engineer, have been pivotal in driving the evolution of their technology landscape.\nLeveraging my experience and expertise from my venture, Dev3loper.ai, I have integrated advanced AI, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Extreme Programming (XP) practices into their projects. These innovative approaches have led to significant recognition and set the stage for future advancements within BNY Mellon's platforms. The collaboration underscores our commitment to delivering transformative software solutions that empower users and drive business growth.\nOur work at BNY Mellon exemplifies excellence in Large Enterprise, Financial Technology, Software Development, and Generative AI. Utilizing Generative AI in the development process and within the application itself, we've successfully extracted and analyzed information from financial documents, significantly boosting operational efficiency and decision-making processes.\nFirst Engagement: Portfolio Analytics for Pershing X\nProject Overview\nEngagement Period: March 2023 – December 2023\nDuring my initial tenure with BNY Mellon, I spearheaded developing a sophisticated Portfolio Analytics Platform integrated with the Wove Platform. This tool was designed to empower financial advisors by enabling the creation and analysis of portfolios comprising securities, mutual funds, ETFs, and model investments.\nTechnologies and Applications\nThe technological stack utilized for this project included:\n\nBackend: Java (Spring)\nFrontend: Angular (TypeScript)\nDatabase: SQL, NoSQL\n\nTeam Dynamics\nOur core team consisted of four engineers from Artium, working closely with numerous BNY Mellon's Investment Research team members. This collaborative approach ensured the seamless integration of technical and industry expertise.\nImpact and Practices\nMy primary contribution was the introduction of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Extreme Programming (XP) practices, which significantly enhanced code quality and accelerated delivery timelines. New to BNY Mellon's traditionally conservative environment, these practices revolutionized their development processes, fostering agility and collaboration.\nThrough dedicated mentorship, I significantly impacted several engineers' careers, who continue to seek guidance. This cultural shift benefitted the project and enriched the professional growth of BNY Mellon's engineering staff.\nOutcomes\nThe Portfolio Analytics Platform was a resounding success, providing advisors with powerful analytical tools and earning multiple accolades. The Wove Platform was notably recognized as one of the \"World's Best Innovations\" by Global Finance Magazine, underscoring the project's impact. These outcomes align with the Dev3loper.ai mission of delivering transformative software solutions that empower users and drive business growth.\nSecond Engagement: Bridge - Alternative Investments\nProject Overview\nEngagement Period: March 2024 – Present\nReturning in March 2024, I am currently leading the development of the Bridge platform, explicitly focusing on Alternative Investments. This Turnkey Asset Management Platform (TAMP) aims to revolutionize how financial advisors manage alternative investments, building upon the foundation laid in my previous engagement.\nTechnologies and Applications\nThe current technological stack includes:\n\nBackend: Python (Fast API)\nFrontend: TypeScript AngularJS\nDatabase: MongoDB with an event-driven persistence architecture\nAI Integration: OpenAI API for data extraction\nAI Tools: GitHub Copilot integrated into the IDE for enhanced development efficiency and as a pair programming partner\n\nTeam Dynamics\nOur team has scaled to include about a dozen engineers, working collaboratively with numerous teams at BNY Mellon. This extensive team interaction ensures the rapid integration of software that aligns perfectly with stakeholder expectations and client needs.\nImpact and Practices\nIn this engagement, I have advocated using AI tools like GitHub Copilot, aligning with Dev3loper.ai's focus on AI-driven efficiency. Initiating a \"Definition of the Day\" related to Alternative Investments, generated using GitHub Copilot, has fostered continued learning and team engagement.\nTransitioning from a prolonged requirements-gathering phase with Ernst & Young, we rapidly developed functional, user-centric software. Our agile practices allowed us to transform gathered requirements into functional, user-centric software swiftly. We've consistently exceeded expectations, earning numerous stakeholder accolades for our innovative and dynamic approach.\nOutcomes Anticipated\nWith billions in capital already committed to the platform, our team is on track to deliver a revolutionary TAMP by the end of 2024. BNY Mellon's commitment to innovation, bolstered by our advanced technologies and agile methodologies, positions us to achieve significant recognition and offer unparalleled tools to financial advisors. These efforts reflect Dev3loper.ai's commitment to delivering high-impact solutions that drive substantial business outcomes.\nConclusion\nPartnering with BNY Mellon through Artium has been a testament to the power of expert consulting, advanced technology, and innovative methodologies. From developing the award-winning Wove Platform to creating a groundbreaking TAMP, this journey highlights the synergy between cutting-edge technology, AI integration from Dev3loper.ai, and financial expertise. This collaboration continues to drive forward the mission of empowering financial advisors worldwide.\n\n\nGet In TouchWe'd love to hear from you!
