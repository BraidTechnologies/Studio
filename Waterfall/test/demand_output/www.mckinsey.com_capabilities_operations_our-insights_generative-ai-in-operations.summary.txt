"Generative AI, when integrated into operations, should be viewed as part of a broader digital transformation, addressing business challenges rather than merely advancing technology. McKinsey & Company explores its impact across the operations value chain, emphasizing the need for operational readiness, tech development, and enhancing experiences for employees and customers. Insights from industry leaders highlight that early adopters witness significant improvements in various sectors including customer care, R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and supply chain. The transition to widespread adoption demands discipline, speed, and scaled impact for maximum productivity. Generative AI has also reshaped quality assurance in customer care, productivity in manufacturing, and provided deeper insights in finance. Overall, it shows tremendous potential but requires strategic implementation to transform business operations effectively."
