technologies for generating creative content are improving rapidly, but seamless ways of using them still aren’t widely available.We’re changing that, and making these incredible technologies more easily accessible to millions of creators and billions of users around the world. Over the next few months, we’re bringing our advanced generative AI models, Veo and Imagen 3, to YouTube creators through Dream Screen.From our groundbreaking Transformer architecture to years of research in diffusion models, these models are built on nearly a decade of innovation at Google and are now optimized for wide-scale use.Throughout this journey, we’ve worked closely with artists and creators and have been guided by their curiosity and feedback to ensure our technologies help more people realize their creative vision.\n\n\nCreators can soon generate video with Dream ScreenBy integrating Veo into Dream Screen, YouTube creators will soon be able to generate exciting backgrounds for their Shorts. Early next year, we’re also making it possible to generate 6 second standalone video clips.Starting with an initial text prompt, Dream Screen uses Imagen 3 to generate four different images. Creators can pick an image in their preferred style, composition or aesthetic from these options. With the selected image, Veo generates a high-quality 6 second background video, tailored to the user’s creative vision.In 2025, creators will also be able to use Dream Screen for generating 6 second standalone video clips for their Shorts, like a cinematic underwater reveal of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing creativity for everyoneWe hope these new video and music generation technologies will inspire more people to bring their ideas to life in vivid, transformative ways.To help identify AI-generated content, these creations will be watermarked using SynthID, and YouTube will apply a label that clearly communicates to viewers that it was generated with AI.We’re continuing to improve our generative AI models and look forward to helping build technologies that unlock creativity for everyone, everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Dream Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about Veo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about Imagen 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated posts\n\n\n\nView all posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnologies\nGenerating audio for video\nVideo-to-audio research uses video pixels and text prompts to generate rich soundtracks\n\n\n17 June 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter links\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Google DeepMind\n\n\nResponsibility & Safety\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGemini\n\n\nVeo\n\n\nImagen 3\n\n\nSynthID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Sign up for updates on our latest innovations\n                  \n\n\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email (e.g., \"name@example.com\")\n\n\n\n\nI accept Google's Terms and Conditions and acknowledge that my information will be used in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.Sign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Google\n\n\nGoogle products\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nManage cookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
