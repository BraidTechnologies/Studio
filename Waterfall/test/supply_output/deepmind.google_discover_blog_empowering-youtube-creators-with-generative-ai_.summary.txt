"Google DeepMind is enhancing YouTube's content creation capabilities by integrating advanced generative AI models, Veo and Imagen 3, into YouTube Shorts through a tool called Dream Screen. This initiative aims to empower millions of creators by making it easier to generate high-quality video content. With Dream Screen, creators can use text prompts to generate images and then convert these into 6-second video backgrounds or standalone clips. Early next year, users will be able to generate standalone video clips as well. To ensure transparency, AI-generated content will be watermarked using SynthID, and YouTube will label such content clearly."
