With success came an increased urgency to shore up the technology landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Transformative Solution\nPublicis Sapient in collaboration with Nationwide developed Speed Layer: a near real-time cache built on a modern technology stack that stores important data in a highly scalable store – structured for consumption. That means Speed Layer collects changes to legacy data “systems of record” in real-time using change data capture and streaming technologies.\nMany different applications can access newly acquired data through microservices and APIs. In other words, all digital channels can integrate the new source of data quickly and easily. This streamlines the entire process of connecting complicated systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Speed Layer project has been transformative for Nationwide. With the support of Publicis Sapient, we have created a fast, modern, secure and scalable digital foundation for the society that has enabled us to unlock new ways to bring richer experiences to our members.”\n\nGrant Valentine\n,\nDelivery Lead at Nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Business Impact\nThe results are astonishing. Speed Layer microservices take just 7 milliseconds response time. It takes less than 45 minutes daily for Speed Layer to reconcile all the data (300m records) within MongoDB and Kafka topics against the “systems of record.” Advanced engineering and performance testing practices saved around £4 million in infrastructure costs.\nFirst and foremost, Speed Layer introduced a new data layer that enabled Nationwide to create a robust ecosystem of digital services that are always online and resilient to outages. The solution’s two-speed IT strategic architecture lets Nationwide evolve customer-facing digital capabilities at high speeds while decoupling legacy systems that roll out new functionality at a slower pace.\nFurthermore, by standardising data access for channels, Speed Layer empowers the building society to launch more digital, customer-focused products while harnessing data for strategic business insights. Speed Layer is an enabler for innovation through data enrichment techniques and event stream processing to drive future customer products such as real-time notifications, personalised banking products, fraud monitoring and many more potential use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7ms\nresponse time \n\n\n~ £4 million\nsavings in infrastructure costs\n\n\n> 95%\nautomated coverage in test scenarios\n\n\n< 45 minute\ndata reconciliation of ~ 300 mill records daily\n\n\n~ 300 million\nrecords loaded in MongoDB with real-time streaming before launch\n\n\n> 24 million\nweekly app log ins supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Hirst\nDirector, Program Management\n\n\n Let's connect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\nNationwide Breaks New Ground in Mortgages  \nPublicis Sapient created a digital platform to execute and scale Nationwide’s comprehensive mortgage options for people over 55.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t View case study \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\nNew Asset Management Brand and Platform \nCreating a new digital experience platform and a digital-focused brand to give Ninety One an edge for the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t View case study \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\nAGTB Revolutionizes Trade Banking\nHow AGTB became the world’s first fully digital trade finance bank in a matter of months. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t View case study \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nComments\n\nWhat's your favorite film?\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to take the next step?
