No Nationwide spokespeople were available for comment before launch but it's interesting to sketch out the benefits and risks of this pioneering computer change before it lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe £300m, five-year project - named Voyager - is in collaboration with IBM and CapGemini, and will plonk all the building society's banking transactions, previously crunched by Unisys and Fujitsu mainframes, on virtualised servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany's Deutsche Bank began a similar move off its 40-year-old legacy system to SAP in 2010.\nBilled as a business transformation plan, 80 per cent of the cash will go on tech: configuring the SAP servers to do the same tasks that the Big Iron - the mainframe - has handled for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stated goal was to streamline business processes, improve turnaround, and speed up processing on applications and transactions.\n\nMainframes have been at the heart of banking IT since they were\n\ninvented: An Amdahl 470V/6 mainframe computer from 1975\n\nHow it works now\nMainframes have clocked bank transactions since they were invented. They are huge computers, generally running z/OS, mostly produced by IBM and they process transactions in batches.\nIn banking, all the day's back-and-forth transactions are run up into batches and processed in sequence.\nWhen you buy a £3 coffee on your card, that £3 will appear to be debited from your account and credited to Starbucks in real time but it won’t be sent there until that night. The coffee transaction will be be filed up in a batch along with the millions of other customer transactions that day, and processed, in sequence, by the mainframe computer.\nMainframes work, but as the nature of banking changes - transactions have massively increased and there is more demand for real-time banking - Nationwide has decided they want them out.\nNationwide's director of business systems transformation Darin Brumby told Computing in 2008:\n\nOur previous system was a known legacy infrastructure that was restrictive to Nationwide's future growth plans.\n\nIt is about performance not cost-cutting, Brumby said. And given the crash at RBS/Natwest over the summer, bank management is much more acutely aware of how important the performance of their IT is, and sensitive to the fact that cost-cutting can cost more if things go wrong.\nIt was a mistake configuring a batch for the mainframe that put 17 million accounts out of sync and sent the transaction processing centre juddering to a halt for several days. RBS had to spend at least £125m in compensation and other costs. Then there was reputational damage of course, particularly unwelcome in the banking sector.\nSo what have Nationwide got to gain by jumping ship to SAP for Banking:\nPros and cons\nGetting the staff: New grads aren't coming out of uni trained in COBOL - the transaction processing language run on mainframes. Having more commonly used systems such as SAP means more people can use them. At a time when banks are going global, staff are employed around the world on short contracts, not trained for years in head office. Like the new labour market or not, it seems to be how the world is going.\nReal-time: Having real-time transactions suits a world where the quantity of transactions has massively increased. Instead of having to wait for batches to fill up and clear, banks will know be able to locate their money and pinpoint transactions quickly, and it could help to catch anomalies quicker.\nFlexibility: Mainframes are hugely expensive - both to buy and to maintain - and need to be run at close to max capacity to get a reasonable return on investment. Servers can scale up and down to demand and that’s cheaper for banks.\nInsights: SAP has bundled up its transaction software with business services and running the transactions through SAP servers will give banks a better grasp of what’s going on and when.\nAnd the risks? Transferring the transactions of a national bank mid-operation is a huge risk. But transfer terror aside - it’s virgin territory for a bank of this size so it remains to be seen what the downsides are.\nBystanders will fear that some of the reliability and rigorous checking procedures built into mainframes will be lost.\nOnly one way to find out. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Mainframe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n×\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Mainframe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Z-series\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Mainframe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n×\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Mainframe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Z-series\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIBM's mainframe bubble bursts and growth stalls\nRed Hat still glowing, but Big Blue's been bruised by investors\n\nSystems21 days | 17\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMainframes aren't dead, they're just learning AI tricks\nKyndryl survey suggests there's life in big iron yet\n\nSystems2 months | 13\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNTT Data, IBM team on mainframe cloud for banks\nSimpliZCloud is only for India right now, based on big Blue's LinuxONE\n\nOff-Prem2 months | 4\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuantum computing is coming – are you ready?\nAre you prepared for the day that quantum computing breaks today’s encryption?\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIBM reveals upcoming chips to power large-scale AI on next-gen big iron\nTelum II Processor and Spyre Accelerator set to boost performance and expand IO capacity\n\nSystems3 months | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou're not hallucinating: Generative AI is helping IBM's mainframes grow\nBig Blue brings in more cash and profit than predicted\n\nSystems4 months | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBMC's $1.6B victory over IBM is TKO on appeal\nAlways read the terms and conditions carefully\n\nApplications1 May 2024 | 21\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIBM gives z/OS an AI infusion in major upgrade aimed in part at easing admin chores\nBig Blue bakes in brainbox tech to get models running – because kids these days don't want a career in big iron\n\nOSes9 Aug 2023 | 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLaid-off 60-year-old Kyndryl exec says he was told IT giant wanted 'new blood'\nAs spinoff quietly erases claim that average age in mainframe group was 35\n\nOn-Prem2 Jun 2023 | 54\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBT taps Kyndryl to migrate mainframe apps to the cloud\nApplications to do with legacy copper and consumer broadband 'cannot be shut down'\n\nOn-Prem2 Feb 2023 | 21\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIBM shrinks z16 and LinuxONE systems into standard rack configs\nThat means more space and less energy consumption\n\nOn-Prem5 Apr 2023 | 15\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOpenText CEO: Micro Focus buy is an enterprise portfolio play\n\nInterview Climbing the software stack, new owner sees IBM and ServiceNow as rivals\n\nSoftware4 May 2023 | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nContact us\nAdvertise with us\nWho we are\n\n\n\nOur Websites\n\nThe Next Platform\nDevClass\nBlocks and Files\n\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\nCookies Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTs & Cs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Copyright.
