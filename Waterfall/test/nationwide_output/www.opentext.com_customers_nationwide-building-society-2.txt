As a member-owned organization, Nationwide strives to provide the best value in banking.\nAmitesh Mishra, CIO for customer experience platforms at Nationwide, confirmed, “Because we’re not a bank, we don't have shareholders. This means we can invest everything back into our members—helping to improve their lives and financial wellbeing.”\nAs part of its commitment to service excellence, Nationwide is always looking for better ways to engage with its members. Following the publication of the Consumer Duty regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the ability to deliver clear, timely communications has now become a regulatory requirement.\n“There are many important aspects to the Consumer Duty regulation,” continued Mishra. “From a communication perspective, we need to ensure that we are providing clear information to customers about the products we offer and the choices available to them. It’s also crucial that this information is accessible to all—for example, through the use of formats such as Braille and large print.”\nIn the past, Nationwide worked with a third-party provider to create, manage and distribute communications to its millions of members across the UK. However, this approach made it difficult for the organization to make changes to customer communications.\n“We wanted to deliver more personalized, relevant, and consistent experiences to our customers on their channel of choice,” said Mishra, “So, we decided to completely transform our approach to communications and personalization.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, it took as long as 12 weeks to create a new communications template—but with Exstream, we’ve cut that down to just two weeks.\nAmitesh MishraCIO for Customer Experience Platforms, Nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nWorking with OpenText Professional Services, Nationwide moved its print communications to OpenText Exstream: a secure, cost-effective and agile customer communication management platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts deployed\n\n\nOpenText™ Exstream\nExstream is a CCM tool that scales to fit the customer engagement needs of any department or complex enterprise environment\n\n\nOpenText™ Media Management\nQuickly and securely access rich media assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices provided\n\n\nOpenText™ Professional Services\nWith knowledge and innovation from more than 50,000 engagements, OpenText Professional Services has the world’s largest pool of OpenText product and solution certified consultants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a proven customer communication management solution\nBy selecting Exstream as its new customer communication management platform, Nationwide was confident that it could accelerate and enhance its ability to deliver tailored print communications that comply with the new Consumer Duty requirements.\n“I implemented Exstream in a previous role at another large bank, so I knew first-hand that the solution would be easy to implement and deliver the personalization capabilities we wanted,” recalled Mishra. “The OpenText solution also offers a very user-friendly content authoring experience, which means that you don’t need to be a technical expert to build high-quality communications.”\nEngaged expert support from OpenText Professional Services\nTo unlock the benefits of Exstream rapidly, Nationwide engaged experts from OpenText Professional Services to provide support throughout the implementation process.\n“Our main goal was to quickly migrate our print communications to the new solution without any disruption to our member communications during the process,” said Mishra. “OpenText Professional Services really helped us to hit the ground running—the support they provided was fantastic. The team understood our problem statements very quickly. With their assistance, we migrated even our most complex document templates to the new platform ahead of our go-live target.”\nMigrating with zero disruption for end users\nThrough its partnership with OpenText, Nationwide achieved its goal of a seamless migration to the new solution. Deployed in the Microsoft Azure cloud, Exstream enables the building society to engage with its members more effectively than ever.\n“We stood up the entire OpenText solution in the cloud and onboarded around 95% of our mission-critical communications within just eight weeks—an outstanding achievement,” commented Mishra. “As a result, we successfully avoided any downstream impact on customers while enhancing our ability to deliver compelling and compliant communications.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the OpenText solution will help us reduce the amount of paper we use and shrink our carbon footprint.\nAmitesh MishraCIO for Customer Experience Platforms, Nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nToday, Nationwide uses Exstream to produce 133 million print communications for 16 million customers each year, including mission-critical documents across all the building society’s product lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerating content workflows by 83%\nBy bringing its customer communications in house with Exstream, Nationwide can meet and exceed its regulatory requirements while delighting its millions of members with relevant and timely communications.\n“In the past, it took as long as 12 weeks to create a new communications template—but with Exstream, we’ve cut that down to just two weeks,” said Mishra. “As well as accelerating our content workflows by 83%, the OpenText solution enables our users to create communications without support from IT. We’re even using Exstream to accelerate our internal print communications; it’s transformed our approach from end to end.”\nSupporting sustainability objectives\nNationwide is committed to delivering environmentally sustainable operations, including a long-term objective to move to paperless operations. With support for all communication types and digital channels, Exstream will help the building society on its sustainability journey.\nMishra confirmed, “We currently produce around 133 million items of print every year. Because we produce these communications with Exstream, we can seamlessly switch our delivery channel from paper to digital as soon as customers update their delivery preferences. Ultimately, the OpenText solution will help us reduce the amount of paper we use and shrink our carbon footprint.”\nEnabling personalized, omnichannel communications\nWith Exstream at the heart of its customer communication management strategy, Nationwide is poised to deliver hyper-personalized communications on each member’s preferred channel.\n“We want to personalize our outreach based on a 360-degree view of each customer’s needs and preferences,” explained Mishra. “For example, if a customer comes to our website looking for a loan, we want to be able to rapidly identify them as an existing customer and surface a personalized offer via their Nationwide mobile app within seconds. With Exstream, we will be able to deliver real-time communications on every channel.”\nPreparing for an AI-enabled future\nNationwide is now building on its partnership with OpenText to further refine its approach to customer communications. The building society plans to integrate Exstream with OpenText Digital Asset Management to centralize and standardize its content assets, and to explore the potential of generative AI to streamline the content creation process.\n“With OpenText as our content management partner, we are in an excellent position to drive even closer and more personalized engagement with our members,” concluded Mishra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationwide Building Society gives member communications the personal touch\nGuest author Amitesh Mishra, CIO for Customer Experience Platforms, explains how the organization accelerated its content workflows by 83% with OpenText™ Exstream.\n\nRead now \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we help?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout OpenText\n\n\n\n\nOpenText Blogs\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenText footer\n\n\n\n\n\nResources forResources for\n\n\nCareers\nDevelopers\nInvestors\nPartners\nSuppliers\n\n\n\n\nAbout OpenTextAbout OpenText\n\n\nOverview\nCorporate Citizenship\nLeadership\nBoard of Directors\nCorporate governance\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is...What is...\n\n\nInformation Management\nArtificial Intelligence\nCybersecurity\nContent Management\nDigital Transformation\n\n\n\n\nNews & EventsNews & Events\n\n\nPress room\nEvents & Webinars\nOpenText World\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick linksQuick links\n\n\nDemos\nCustomer stories\nCEO Thought Leadership\nLearning Paths\n\n\n\n\nContact usContact us\n\n\nHow can we help?\nGlobal locations\nCustomer support\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is available for the following regions.\n\n\nAmericas\n\nBrasil (Português)\nUnited States (English)\n\n\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nDeutschland (Deutsch)\nEspaña (Español)\nFrance (Français)\nSverige (Svenska)\nUnited Kingdom (English)\n\n\n\nAsia–Pacific\n\nAustralia (English)\n日本 (日本語)\n한국 (한국어)\n中国 (简体中文)\n台灣 (繁體中文)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-800-499-6544\n\nCall us now!\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCookies Settings\nModern Slavery Statement\n\n\n\nOpenText on LinkedIn\n\nOpenText on Twitter\n\nOpenText on Youtube\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 Open Text Corporation.
