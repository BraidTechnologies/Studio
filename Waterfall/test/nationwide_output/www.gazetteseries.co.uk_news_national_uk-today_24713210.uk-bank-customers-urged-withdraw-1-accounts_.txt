Challenger banks are offering attractive returns and it would be unwise to overlook them when they have the same protections in place as a high street bank.\n\n\n\n  \"Savers need to proactively keep on top of the best rates and review their pots regularly to see if they are getting a raw deal.\"\n\n\n  Principality Building Society's Six Month Regular Saver offers an impressive 8% interest on savings, with a minimum deposit requirement of just £1 per month.\n\n\n  The rate is fixed for 6 months until the bond matures (when the account comes to an end). The estimated balance would be after 6 months based on depositing £200 every calendar month, an eye-watering £1,227.53.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading:\n\n\nNationwide: Customers offered £20,000 interest free loans\n\n\nNationwide Building Society will offer bigger 0% loans for green retrofitting\n\n\n\nNationwide adverts banned by watchdog as branches closed\n\n\n\n  This is based on you paying £200 a month for 6 months and making the first payment on the date the account was opened.\n\n\n  This calculation is for guidance only, to show you what a future balance could look like. It does not consider your circumstances.\n\n\n  The building society says: \"Our 6 Month Regular Saver is designed to help you save on a regular basis over six months. You don't have to pay in money every month.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Personal Finance\n\n \n\n \nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Comments: Our rules\n            \n\n\n                    We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
