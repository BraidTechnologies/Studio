Issues involved were discussed. The management of the bank (Bank of India) explained the reasons for issuing the charge sheets. The FOBOISU explained the factual matrix of the incident connected with the conference of Bank of India Staff Union, Kerala and informed that BOISU, Kerala had taken immediate and adequate measures to ensure that the name of the Bank is not put into any harm or disrepute and it was only the outsiders/external forces who had unleashed a false propaganda and spread distorted facts on social media.

Facts disclosed in course of the discussions and having regard to the facts that have emerged during the discussions, it has been found to be satisfactory and accordingly the management decided not to proceed further in the matter against the concerned employees/office bearers with any departmental proceedings and in view of this, the AIBEA and FOBOISU informed their decision to withdraw the proposed strike on 28th August, 2024.\"Read More News onbank of indiabank strikenationwideAIBEAbanksAll India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA)ibahdfc bank(Catch all the Personal Finance News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
