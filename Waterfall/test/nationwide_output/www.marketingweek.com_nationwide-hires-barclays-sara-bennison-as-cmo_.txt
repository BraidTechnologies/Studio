Its ‘On your side’ and ‘You don’t need a bank you do need a bank account’ taglines and positioning – an attempt to exploit the lack of trust in high street banks following the financial crisis – have helped it post huge profit increases in recent years, 54% year on year in its last financial year.\nIt also enjoys the highest Index rating – a balance of scores for quality, value, corporate reputation, and satisfaction – on YouGov’s BrandIndex from a list of 28 financial services brands.\nThe decision to elevate the CMO role to the group’s executive committee indicates the “importance the society places on further enhancing our brand and reputation”, according to a spokesman. Nationwide has considerable marketing expertise on its board including former Interbrand CEO Rita Clifton and former marketer and its group retail director Chris Rhodes.\nMarketing director Stephen Leonard, also a member of the Vision 100, will report to Bennison.\nBennison is a well-known figure in the marketing industry, sitting on the board of advertising industry trade body ISBA and the IPA’s client council. She is also a Fellow of the Marketing Society.\nShe is the second senior marketer Barclays has lost this year following the departure of David Wheldon for RBS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nNews Nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Uncategorized RBS looks to replicate Barclays’ reputation turnaround as it hires David Wheldon as CMO Alison Millington \nRBS has appointed Barclays’ David Wheldon to the newly created role of chief marketing officer as it looks to become the most trusted bank by 2020 by changing customer perceptions.\n\n\n\n14 Apr 2015\n1:31 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Vision 100: the big questions – Is it important to maintain your own development?
