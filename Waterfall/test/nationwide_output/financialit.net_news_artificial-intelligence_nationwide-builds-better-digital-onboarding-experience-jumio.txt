One of these needs is the flexibility to open and manage accounts online without the use of a physical bank branch. Nationwide’s partnership with Jumio allows exactly this, offering a fast, convenient online application process for customers. Jumio’s API uses a proprietary mix of AI, machine learning and other advanced technologies to determine if an identity document is authentic and belongs to the user. Jumio seamlessly integrates with Nationwide’s existing workflows to determine — through a simple API call — if applicants are who they say they are and allows Nationwide to make an informed decision about the applicant based on a variety of powerful fraud signals.  Jumio also verifies the age of Nationwide’s youngest members by extracting personal information, such as date of birth, from a wide variety of government-issued IDs, which can be used to calculate the current age of an applicant before allowing them to open a youth account.  Since integrating Jumio into its workflow, Nationwide has experienced more streamlined and efficient KYC processes, resulting in higher conversion rates.  “With Jumio we’re able to provide an end-to-end digital process for the majority of our customers,” said Carlo Mascia, Nationwide delivery lead. “The time it takes to open an account has been dramatically reduced, but the customer experience is the greatest win.”  “We are proud to partner with Nationwide as they help more than 15 million members save and prosper,” said Mark Reeves, Jumio’s VP of EMEA. “By using Jumio’s AI-powered solutions, Nationwide is able to provide a seamless digital onboarding experience to customers of all ages.”    Related News   GFT Taps NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Omniverse...  12.11.2024   05:25 pm    BlueFlame AI Launches AI-Powered DDQ Manager  01.11.2024   02:05 pm    NayaOne To Accelerate Enterprise Adoption Of...  24.10.2024   09:25 am    Cohesity Enhances Gen AI Capabilities With Advanced...  22.10.2024   02:05 pm    Worldline And FinbotsAI Team Up To Put AI Credit...  15.10.2024   10:15 am    Link FX And Time Machine Capital Squared (TMC2) Forge...  14.10.2024   09:25 am    Wolters Kluwer Survey: AI Is Transforming the Office...  10.10.2024   03:15 pm    Bridgewise Launches BRIDGET™, World’s First...  03.10.2024   09:05 am    UAE Leads the AI Revolution as Global Markets Struggle...  19.09.2024   02:11 pm    Money20/20 USA Agenda Dives Deeper Into The...  19.09.2024   11:29 am    OneStream Reveals AI-Powered Anomaly Detection  19.09.2024   10:21 am    Youverse CEO to Discuss Responsible AI in Biometrics...  17.09.2024   11:50 am \n\n\nLatest Issue   Free Newsletter Subscription   \n\n Leave this field blank   FinTech List Payment gateways     Challenger banks     Challenger banks     Challenger banks     Challenger banks    Popular Tags Banking Data Consultancy Transaction Banking RegTech Security/Compliance Cloud Trading Systems Blockchain FinTech StartUps M&A Deals Infrastructure Artificial Intelligence Contact us +44 (0) 208 819 32 53+44 (0) 173 261 71 47news@financialit.netsales@financialit.net NavigationAbout usAdvertisingContact UsCookiesMedia kitTerms of Use Mobile Apps       Stay Connected   © 2024, Financial IT.
