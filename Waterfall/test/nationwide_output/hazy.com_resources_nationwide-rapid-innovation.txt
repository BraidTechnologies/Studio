Banks are speeding up their innovation as a result; many are working with third parties to innovate faster by capitalising on external tech firms' specialised expertise and applications. This approach offers huge potential for banks to tap into additional capability faster and more cost-effectively but faces a significant challenge: the ability to share data.Recognising the opportunity of bringing in new technology in to the business, Nationwide is increasingly looking to work with fintechs. To do this successfully, the teams need to test the capability of potential vendors using core data assets, which are lengthy and difficult to sign off. \n\n\nSolution\nNationwide faced a common challenge – and synthetic data was the answer. By creating synthetic data, Hazy enabled Nationwide to unlock value, share data quickly and securely with third parties, and accelerate its innovation programmes.Using a generative model, Hazy extracted the statistical information and complex relationships contained within Nationwide’s transaction data, creating a synthetic data set that no longer contained any of the original information.This process eliminated any possibility that the data could be traced back to the source, providing total protection to Nationwide’s customers, and ensuring regulatory compliance.To deliver the synthetic data efficiently and securely to collaborators, Nationwide built a secure sandbox environment on Azure to host the synthetic data.Hazy's generator model can be deployed quickly to new sandbox environments and used to generate safe synthetic data the third party can access. \n\n\nImpact\nNationwide and Hazy solved the historic challenge of creating safe, representative, GDPR-compliant data to share with third parties to generate actionable insights and increase the speed of innovation.This is a vital driver to remain competitive in an evolving landscape that is being transformed by unforeseen changes to the economy, aggressive new entrants, new regulations such as Open Banking and challenger fintech platform strategies. Hazy’s synthetic data solution has shown it can meet these challenges head on. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS acquires Hazy synthetic data software to boost generative AI portfolio\n\nRead full release        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n          Related case studies        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Case study\n            \n\n\nAccenture unlocks customer project with synthetic data\n\n\n        Accenture used Hazy’s synthetic data to build and test a new Fostering Better Finance application fo…      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Case study\n            \n\n\nGlobal automotive company uses Hazy to boost data provisioning\n\n\n        Hazy helps global automotive company provision safe, representative credit risk data at lightning sp…      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Case study\n            \n\n\nFintech uses Hazy to improve open banking product\n\n\n        Hazy works with ML Fintech to solve the cold start problem, delivering the training data they need t…      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrusted by the world’s most ambitious companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Hazy?\n\n\n\nWhat is synthetic data?\n\n\n\n\nWhy synthetic data\n\n\n\n\nWhy Hazy?\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\n\nOur platform\n\n\n\n\nPlatform features\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise success\n\n\n\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\n\nTransform digital infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nAccelerate adoption of AI\n\n\n\n\nEmpower business intelligence\n\n\n\n\nUnlock faster innovation\n\n\n\n\nCommercialise enterprise data\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nBusiness insight\n\n\n\n\nTech insight\n\n\n\n\nCompany news\n\n\n\n\nCase studies\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\n\nAbout Hazy\n\n\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n\n\n\n\nhazy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ©\n        2024        Hazy Limited.\n        UK Company #10804708\n\n\n\n\nLegal\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nCookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to analyse and improve our service to you.
