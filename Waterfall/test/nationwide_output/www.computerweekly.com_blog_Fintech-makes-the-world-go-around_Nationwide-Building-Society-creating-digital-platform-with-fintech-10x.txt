Nationwide has invested heavily in tech over the last decade to bring its IT up to date and has not looked back with funky apps and capabilities offered to its customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is now targeting 5.7 million small businesses with an account that will bring the fintech experiences to small business banking. To this end Nationwide has invested £15m in 10x Future Technologies was set up by former Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins.\nBecause Nationwide doesn’t have a business current account, it is building the service from scratch.\nThe building society has been working with 10x for over six months on ideas around the account. It wants it to be incredibly user friendly. For example the cloud based platform will enable businesses to access their account and associated products and services through both a mobile app and online banking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFintech 10x was building a digital bank for Virgin bank until the contract, which had already cost the bank £38m, was scrapped when it was acquired by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Group.\nNationwide CEO Joe Garner said: “Like us, 10x is aiming to massively improve service in financial services and are therefore a natural partner.”\nMeanwhile Antony Jenkins, founder of 10x Future Technologies, said: “Nationwide is one of the UK’s most trusted and service-centric brands and our digital delivery team looks forward to supporting the Society in setting new standards in business banking – just as good digitally as it is in branch.”\nLloyds Banking Group is another example of a major traditional bank investing in fintechs to get access to latest technology. It is a shareholder of Thought Machine, which is also supplying it with a cloud based core banking platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch CIO\n\n\n\n\nTrump plans to repeal Biden order, limit AI regulation\nDonald Trump might want less regulation, but he has close ties to tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has supported AI regulation, ...\n\n\n\nTech industry will see less regulation under Trump\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will likely repeal President Joe Biden's AI executive order and introduce new tariffs that could ...\n\n\n\nTechTarget editorial advisory boards\nInput from industry experts and thought leaders on different topic areas help shape TechTarget's editorial coverage of the topics...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Security\n\n\n\n\nAmazon employee data leaked from MoveIt Transfer attack\nAlthough Amazon confirms that employee data was leaked, it stresses that data was stolen via a third-party vendor and that only ...\n\n\n\nSIEM vs. SOAR vs. XDR: Evaluate the key differences\nSIEM, SOAR and XDR each possess distinct capabilities and drawbacks.
