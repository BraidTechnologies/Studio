Sessions on \"Large Language Models (LLMs)\" and practical exercises were especially engaging and beneficial, significantly improving technological understanding and reinforcing key concepts. \nParticipants suggested role-specific training and extending the “Gateway Projects” timeline for better outcomes. Real-world solution building was highly valued."
