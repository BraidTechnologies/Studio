"The course met the participant's overall expectations, with appropriate duration and pacing. The \"AI Ethics\" and Large Language Models/Gentrative AI sessions were found valuable and insightful. The practical exercises were engaging. \n\nHowever, the participant felt unprepared for the “Design Thinking” and Vodafone-specific parts and suggests improved support for the “Gateway Projects” build phase, specifically with AI Booster and cloud platforms setup."
