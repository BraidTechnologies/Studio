**AnimatedIconButton.tsx**

This code defines a React component `AnimatedIconButton` that displays an animated button with a lightbulb icon and a dropdown menu.

The `AnimatedIconButton` component uses React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects. It animates the icon color using a sequence of colors and a timer with `setInterval` to update the icon color at regular intervals.

The buttonâ€™s icon color animation is managed by the `animateColours` function and is tied to the `animate` prop. When the button is clicked, props `onClick` and `onCancel` capture the events.

Important functions and hooks: `useForceUpdate`, `AnimatedIconButton`, `animateColours`, `onClick`, `onCancel`. Important class: `animatedGlowIcon`.

**ConversationMessagePrompt.tsx**

This React component `MessagePrompt` facilitates user input via a textarea. It uses `useState` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks to manage the textarea width dynamically. It includes essential props: `message`, `onSend`, and `onChange`, to handle message states and actions.

`wrapText` is a utility function for managing multiline text on a canvas, calculating the required height based on text width and line separations. 

The `calculateDyNeeded` function leverages this utility to compute the necessary height for the wrapped text in the textarea.

`onKeyChange` and `onSend` methods handle text changes and sending actions triggered via keyboard events, with specific handling for Ctrl+Enter to send and Escape to clear the text. The code employs Fluent UI's `makeStyles` for styling.

**ConversationPane.tsx**

This module primarily uses React and Fluent UI libraries to create an interactive conversation interface with user roles, chat control functionalities, and rich UI components.

**MainPageMessage.tsx**

This code defines a React component named `MainPageMessageRow` for displaying various types of messages on a webpage. It imports necessary modules from `@fluentui/react-components` and uses React functions and hooks.

The `EMainPageMessageTypes` enum lists possible message types like `kInformation`, `kWarning`, `kError`, `kSuccess`, and `kNothing`.

The `messageBarStyles` constant is a set of styles created using `makeStyles` from Fluent UI.

The `IMainPageMessageProps` interface defines the expected props for the `MainPageMessageRow` component, including `intent`, `text`, `dismissable`, and `onDismiss`.

The `MainPageMessageRow` component renders differently based on whether the message is dismissable or not. If dismissable, it includes a dismiss button; otherwise, it simply displays the message text. It incorporates conditional rendering and accepts user interactions for message dismissal.

**UIStrings.ts**

This code defines an enumerated type `EUIStrings` that holds various user interface strings used across the application. Each enum member maps to a specific message or label text to standardize the UI content, including prompts, errors, placeholders, conversation names, and instructional messages.

Additionally, there is a variable `initialQuestions` which is an array of strings. This array includes a list of thought-provoking questions related to generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and their usage, which can be used for initiating discussions, generating content, or onboarding users in an educational context.

Important class/function:
- `export enum EUIStrings`
- `export var initialQuestions`
