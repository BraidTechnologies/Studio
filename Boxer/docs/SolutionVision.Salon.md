**Solution Vision: Boxer - AI-Enabled Learning Assistant for Generative AI Development**

**Vision Statement:**

Boxer is an AI-enabled learning assistant, empowering developers to rapidly build generative AI applications by providing **contextualised access to curated learning materials and direct interaction with AI models**. Boxer reduces the time to competency in generative AI, enhancing developer productivity.

**Problem Statement:**

Developers face a steep learning curve when building applications using generative AI technologies. They need to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape of models, techniques and best practices, whilst simultaneously building and deploying working solutions. The key challenges include:

*   **Information Overload**: The volume of information on generative AI is vast, dispersed across numerous sources (YouTube, GitHub, articles, documentation).
*   **Lack of Context**: Finding relevant information within this large volume can be difficult, and it's often disconnected from the specific needs of a developer at a given point in their project.
*   **Keeping Up-to-Date:** The generative AI field is constantly changing and developers need to stay updated with the latest advancements.

**Solution Description:**

Boxer addresses these challenges by providing an integrated platform that combines access to a curated knowledge base with practical AI tools, designed to be used directly by developers. The key features of Boxer include:

*   **AI-Powered Knowledge Base**: Boxer automatically processes and summarizes open-source learning materials from various sources (YouTube videos, GitHub repos, HTML text). It uses AI to generate summaries and organize the content in a document store.
*   **Contextualized Information Retrieval**: The Boxer front-end allows users to ask questions, which are then passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically **GPT-4 on Azure**, and enriched with links to relevant document chunks from the knowledge base. This ensures developers receive precise and relevant information based on their specific needs.
*   **Proactive Suggestions**: Based on student interaction, the model suggests additional relevant content to enhance learning.
*   **Teams Integration**: Boxer integrates with Microsoft Teams via a plug-in, bringing the learning assistant directly into the a team's workflow.
*   **Rapid Content Updates**: The system adapts to rapidly evolving AI fields by processing and summarizing current knowledge.

**Key Features:**

*   **Accelerated Learning:** Boxer reduces time to competency in generative AI by providing direct access to relevant information and tools.
*   **Increased Developer Productivity:** By quickly finding relevant content, developers can be more efficient and productive.
*   **Ease of Content Maintenance:** The system adapts to rapidly evolving AI fields by processing and summarizing current content.
*   **Improved user Confidence**: By providing links to source material alongside AI responses, Boxer provides information that can be more easily validated.
*   **Flexible Content Processing:** Boxer processes various types of content such as YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and HTML text. This content is then used to build a database of summarized documents which can be queried by the LLM.
*   **Contextual Enrichment:** The core feature is the ability to ask questions and receive answers, along with relevant document references. Boxer enriches responses with links to specific and relevant chunks from the database of material, enabling more effective learning.
*   **Multi-user:** The systms used the Microsoft Fluent Framework to replicate conversations across a team.

**Target Users:**

*   Software developers
*   AI engineers
*   Technical students
*   Anyone seeking to learn about building applications using Generative AI

**Future Vision:**

*   The capability of Boxer to integrate with other development tools.
*   More sophisticated personalisation of content for individual users and their team.
*   Addition of more advanced features to enable collaboration and knowledge sharing between users.

This Solution Vision provides a clear picture of what Boxer is, the problem it solves, and its key benefits, making it suitable for communicating the direction of the product to stakeholders and development teams alike.
