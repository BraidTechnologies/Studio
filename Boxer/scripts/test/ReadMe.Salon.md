**test_3chunks_web_pipeline.py**

This code configures and runs unit tests for various functions related to text processing and HTML downloading. 

- It uses **pytest** for running tests and **unittest.mock** for creating mock objects and patching dependencies.
- Key functions from the `enrich_text_chunks` and `download_html` modules are tested, including `append_text_to_previous_chunk`, `add_new_chunk`, `parse_json_mdd_transcript`, and `enrich_text_chunks`.
- Mock configurations, tokenizers, and metadata are created to simulate the actual environment in which these functions would run.
- The **mock_open** and **patch** decorators are used to mock file operations and external HTTP requests, allowing for isolated testing.
- Fixture `mock_file_system` creates a temporary directory structure for testing file system interactions.

**test_utility.py**

This code processes a list of questions through a test pipeline, using OpenAI's API for generating AI-based responses. 

It includes main functions: `get_enriched_question`, `get_text_embedding`, `get_followup_question`, and `assess_followup_question`, all of which use chatGPT for different tasks like enriching a question, getting text embeddings, generating follow-up questions, and assessing if a follow-up is AI-related, respectively. 

The `test_result` class holds results for each test. 

The `run_tests` function initializes logging, processes each question, calculates similarity scores for embeddings, and then gets and assesses follow-up questions, finally saving results to a JSON file. The similarity is computed using the `cosine_similarity` function from NumPy.

**test_web_pipeline.py**

This code tests the functionality of an HTML download and text enrichment pipeline. 

The `create_mock_html_files` function generates mock HTML and metadata files for testing. 

The `test_chunk_addition` function verifies that these chunks are created and processed correctly, checking their integrity and content.

Fixtures like `test_output_dir` and `config` create temporary directories and configuration instances for testing purposes. 

`check_content` verifies that the downloaded content contains data from specific URLs.

`run_pipeline` handles the flow of enriching text chunks, summaries, embeddings, and running lightweight enrichment.

`verify_hit_counts` checks that the expected number of sources has been hit through the processing.

`test_web_pipeline` drives the end-to-end testing of downloading HTML, running the pipeline, and verifying results.

**test_youtube_pipeline.py**

This module is a script designed to test the process of downloading, enriching, and verifying YouTube video transcripts.

- **IgnoreSpecificWarningsFilter (Class)**: Defines a logging filter to ignore specific warning messages.
- **test_output_dir (Function)**: Pytest fixture that creates a temporary directory for storing test outputs.
- **config (Function)**: Pytest fixture that creates and returns an instance of the `ApiConfiguration` class.
- **check_content (Function)**: Verifies if specific content is present in a JSON file.
- **run_pipeline (Function)**: Runs the entire pipeline of transcript enrichment processes.
- **verify_hit_counts (Function)**: Checks hit counts for source URLs and compares them to the expected number.
- **test_youtube_pipeline (Function)**: Comprehensive test function for the YouTube pipeline.
- **test_get_transcript_exceptions (Function)**: Tests `get_transcript` function for various error scenarios using parameterized exceptions.
- **test_get_transcript_success (Function)**: Tests the `get_transcript` function for successful scenarios.
- **test_get_transcript_file_exists (Function)**: Tests the `get_transcript` function when the transcript file already exists.
