**download_transcripts.py**

The script downloads transcripts for videos in a YouTube playlist.

**Important Classes and Functions:**

- **Counter Class**: A thread-safe counter.
    - **increment()**: increments the counter value.
    
- **gen_metadata()**: Generates metadata for a video and saves it as a JSON file.
    - **Inputs**: playlist_item, transcriptDestinationDir.

- **get_transcript()**: Retrieves and saves the transcript of a video.
    - **Inputs**: playlist_item, counter_id, transcriptDestinationDir, logger.

- **process_queue()**: Processes videos in the queue for transcription and metadata generation.
    - **Inputs**: q, counter, transcriptDestinationDir, logger.

- **download_transcripts()**: Main function to initiate downloading transcripts.
    - **Inputs**: playlistId, transcriptDestinationDir.

The YouTube Data API fetches video details, and YouTubeTranscriptApi retrieves the transcripts. Transcripts and metadata are processed and saved in the specified directory. The process uses multithreading for efficiency.

**enrich_transcript_chunks.py**

This script generates a master csv file from transcript files by reading `.json` and `.vtt` files in a specified directory.

The important classes and functions include:

1. **VttChunk**: A class that initializes transcript chunks with start time, duration, and text.
2. **gen_metadata_master**: Generates metadata text for titles and descriptions.
3. **clean_text**: Cleans transcript text by removing unwanted characters and symbols.
4. **append_text_to_previous_chunk**: Appends a portion of the current text to the previous chunk to achieve context overlap.
5. **add_new_chunk**: Adds a new chunk to the list of transcript chunks.
6. **parse_json_vtt_transcript**: Parses the `.json.vtt` file and extracts transcript chunks.
7. **get_transcript**: Retrieves the transcript from the `.vtt` file.
8. **enrich_transcript_chunks**: Processes JSON and VTT transcript files, enriches the chunks, and saves the output.
9. **ensure_directory_exists**: Ensures that the directory for output files exists, creating it if necessary.

The script configures logging, uses `tiktoken` for encoding with the GPT-3.5-turbo model, and utilizes `rich` for progress tracking.

**enrich_transcript_embeddings.py**

This code leverages the OpenAI API for text embedding and log handling within a multi-threaded environment. It starts by importing necessary libraries and modules, including logging, regex, JSON, threading, and queue.

Key functions include:

- `normalize_text`: Cleans text by removing extra spaces and newlines.
- `get_text_embedding`: Retries API requests until successful or after multiple attempts.
- `process_queue`: Processes chunks in a queue, retrieving or generating embeddings, handling errors, and updating progress.
- `convert_time_to_seconds`: Converts timestamps to seconds.
- `enrich_transcript_embeddings`: Main function initializing the API client, setting up logging, reading input, and processing text chunks using multiple threads.

Overall, it reads transcript data, processes it to generate or retrieve embeddings from an OpenAI API, and writes the enriched output back to a file.

**enrich_transcript_summaries.py**

1. **Imports:** The code imports various libraries including standard library modules (`json`, `os`, `threading`, `queue`, `logging`), third-party packages (`openai`, `tenacity`, `rich.progress`), and local modules (`common.common_functions`, `common.ApiConfiguration`).

2. **Class: `Counter`:** A thread-safe counter with a lock mechanism to handle concurrent increments.

3. **Function: `chatgpt_summary`:** A retry-decorated function that uses the AzureOpenAI's `chat` API to generate summaries, retrying on certain errors up to 5 times.

4. **Function: `process_queue`:** Processes text chunks from a queue, generating summaries using `chatgpt_summary`, and handling errors. Updates progress and stores results in a shared list.

5. **Function: `convert_time_to_seconds`:** Converts a `HH:MM:SS` formatted string to seconds.

6. **Function: `enrich_transcript_summaries`:** Loads transcript chunks, processes them using multiple threads, and combines summaries with existing data. Saves the results to a file after processing.

This code is designed to parallelize obtaining summaries for blocks of text that likely come from video transcripts, enrich existing data, and save the results efficiently.

**not_used_enrich_transcript_speaker.py**

This script extracts speaker names from YouTube video metadata and the first minute of the transcript using OpenAI Functions entity extraction.

Important classes and functions:
1. `Counter` class: Provides a thread-safe counter for tracking processed items.
2. `get_speaker_info` function: Uses OpenAI API to extract speaker names from text.
3. `clean_text` function: Cleans the input text by removing unwanted characters.
4. `get_first_segment` function: Reads the first segment of the video's transcript.
5. `process_queue` function: Processes files in a queue, extracting and saving speaker names.

The script uses threading to improve efficiency, retries API requests on failure, and logs progress. It reads metadata and transcripts from JSON files, calls the OpenAI API for entity extraction, and updates files with the extracted speaker names.
