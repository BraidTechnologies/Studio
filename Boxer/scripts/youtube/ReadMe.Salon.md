**download_transcripts.py**

This script downloads transcripts from all videos in a YouTube playlist. It uses the `googleapiclient` library to interface with YouTube API and `YouTubeTranscriptApi` to fetch video transcripts.

The `Counter` class is a thread-safe counter to keep track of processed videos.

The `gen_metadata` function generates and saves metadata for a video.

The `get_transcript` function retrieves the transcript of a video, handles errors, and saves it in `.vtt` format.

The `process_queue` function processes videos from a queue, fetching their transcripts and metadata.

The `download_transcripts` function initializes the YouTube API client, handles pagination to fetch all playlist videos, and uses threading to download transcripts concurrently.

**enrich_transcript_chunks.py**

1. Constants and Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries and defines constants like `PERCENTAGE_OVERLAP` and `ENCODING_MODEL`.

2. Classes: The `VttChunk` class is used to store VTT file data segments with attributes: text, start time, and duration.

3. Functions: 
   - `gen_metadata_master`: Cleans and generates metadata for the CSV file.
   - `clean_text`: Cleans unwanted characters and spaces from the transcript text.
   - `append_text_to_previous_chunk`: Appends a percentage of overlap text to the previous chunk.
   - `add_new_chunk`: Adds a new chunk to the chunks list based on the given metadata and text.

4. Main Processing:
   - `parse_json_vtt_transcript`: Reads and processes VTT files, segments text into chunks, and handles metadata.
   - `get_transcript`: Fetches the transcript file and invokes parsing.
   - `enrich_transcript_chunks`: Reads metadata from JSON files, processes the transcripts, and generates the master CSV file.

5. Utilities:
   - `ensure_directory_exists`: Ensures that a specified directory exists, creating it if it does not.

6. Logging: Configured with a warning level.

**enrich_transcript_embeddings.py**

The provided code processes text data to generate embeddings using the Azure OpenAI service. It imports necessary standard libraries and third-party packages.

The `normalize_text` function cleans up whitespace and punctuation issues in text. The `get_text_embedding` function retries embedding fetching with exponential backoff on failures.

The `process_queue` function processes queued text chunks: it retrieves embeddings for new text, handles existing summaries, and catches errors. Progress is tracked with a `Progress` class.

The `convert_time_to_seconds` function converts time formatted strings into seconds.

The `enrich_transcript_embeddings` function initializes API clients and logger, loads data, and manages a queue with threading. It ensures all enriched data is processed, sorted, and saved to a file.

Important functions:
- `normalize_text`
- `get_text_embedding`
- `process_queue`
- `convert_time_to_seconds`
- `enrich_transcript_embeddings`

**enrich_transcript_summaries.py**

**Important Classes and Functions:**
1. **Counter**
2. **chatgpt_summary**
3. **process_queue**
4. **convert_time_to_seconds**
5. **enrich_transcript_summaries**

**Summary:**

This code imports various libraries and sets up key components for concurrent processing of transcript chunks to summarize their content using OpenAI's API.

The `Counter` class provides a thread-safe way to increment a counter using a lock.

The `chatgpt_summary` function retries up to five times (with an exponential back-off strategy) to get a summary from the OpenAI API, handling specific errors to retry safely.

The `process_queue` function processes chunks of text from a queue in multiple threads, generating summaries or reusing existing data, and updating progress.

The `convert_time_to_seconds` helper function converts timestamp strings to seconds.

The `enrich_transcript_summaries` function initializes the OpenAI client and logger, loads chunks from files, sets up a queue for processing with multiple threads, and saves the enriched summaries back to a JSON file after processing.

**not_used_enrich_transcript_speaker.py**

This script extracts speaker names from YouTube video metadata and the first minute of the transcript using OpenAI's entity extraction.

The script configures OpenAI API settings and retrieves YouTube transcript files from a specified folder using argparse. 

The `Counter` class ensures thread-safe counting.

The `get_speaker_info` function retries on failure and uses OpenAI's API to extract speaker names.

The `clean_text` function standardizes text by removing unnecessary characters.

The `get_first_segment` function retrieves the first segment of the transcript.

The `process_queue` function processes files concurrently using threading and updates metadata with extracted speaker names.

Classes/Functions: `Counter`, `get_speaker_info`, `clean_text`, `get_first_segment`, `process_queue`.
