**ApiConfiguration.py**

The provided code checks whether the Azure mode is enabled via a boolean variable `azure`. Based on the value, it sets appropriate API parameters such as `API_TYPE`, `API_KEY`, `API_VERSION`, and `RESOURCE_ENDPOINT` for Azure or OpenAI services.

The `ApiConfiguration` class initializes and holds various configurations for an API service. It includes attributes like `apiKey`, `apiVersion`, and `resourceEndpoint`, as well as specific parameters for Azure deployments, model names, processing threads, request timeouts, and constraints on summary length, video chunk duration, token limits, and article indexing.

Important class:
- `ApiConfiguration`: Stores API-related configuration settings.

**common_functions.py**

The code imports essential libraries, including `os` for file system operations and `AzureOpenAI` for working with the OpenAI API.

The `ApiConfiguration` class is imported from `common.ApiConfiguration` and an instance of it is created.

The `ensure_directory_exists` function checks if a specified directory exists. If it doesn't, the function creates the directory using `os.makedirs`.

A directory path `HTML_DESTINATION_DIR` is constructed using `os.path.join` for cross-platform compatibility, and `ensure_directory_exists` ensures this directory is created.

The `get_embedding` function generates an embedding for a given text using `AzureOpenAI`. It replaces newline characters with spaces, creates an embedding with the provided model configuration, and returns the embedding result.

**Urls.py**

This code defines a data processing script in Python. It imports essential libraries such as `os`, `json`, and `logging` for file handling, JSON operations, and logging respectively.

There are three pre-defined lists (`youTubeUrls`, `gitHubUrls`, `webUrls`) containing various URL categories and descriptions.

A `UrlHit` class is defined to store information about each URL, including its path, description, and hit count.

The `countUrlHits` function processes a JSON file containing usage data to count hits for each URL. It logs errors for missing input files and accumulates hit counts for URLs based on tracking IDs. Finally, it prints results and saves them to an output file.
